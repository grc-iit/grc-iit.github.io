Evaluating and\\nunderstanding I/O system performance has become a timely\\nissue facing the high performance computing community.\\nConventional I/O performance metrics, such as\\nInput/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS), bandwidth,\\nresponse time, etc., are effective for traditional I/O\\nenvironments. However, as I/O systems become more and\\nmore complex, existing I/O metrics become less and less able\\nto catch the characteristic of I/O systems performance. In\\nthis study, we reveal the limitations of existing metrics, and\\nintroduce a novel I/O metric, Blocks Per Second (BPS), to\\nmeasure the performance of the I/O systems. A unique merit\\nof BPS is that it provides an overall I/O system performance,\\nnot the file system performance or disk performance. This is\\nvery important; since with concurrency and optimization at\\nthe I/O stacks, file system performance and disk\\nperformance no long represent the data access performance.\\nIn fact, they are often misleading. A methodology is designed\\nto measure BPS, and experiments are conducted with\\nvarious I/O access patterns and storage configurations.\\nExperimental results show that BPS is significantly more\\nappropriate than existing metrics in I/O performance\\nevaluation.","authors":["S.
