Grid computing\\ninfrastructure, on another hand, is a shared collaborative\\nenvironment constructed\\non\\nautonomic\\nvirtual\\norganizations. The non-dedicated characteristic of Grid\\ncomputing prevents the leverage of conventional task\\nscheduling systems. In this study, we present the design\\nand development of the Grid Harvest Service (GHS)\\nperformance evaluation and task scheduling system for\\nsolving large-scale applications in a shared network\\nenvironment. GHS combines stochastic models and\\nartificial intelligence learning mechanisms with task\\nscheduling algorithms. It considers both computing and\\nnetwork contention and supports scheduling for single\\ntask, parallel processing, and meta-tasks. Experimental\\nresults show that GHS provides a satisfactory solution for\\nperformance prediction and task scheduling and has a\\nreal potential.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","M.
