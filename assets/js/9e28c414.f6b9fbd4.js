New hardware technologies,\\nsuch as NVMe and SSD, have been introduced in burst buffer installations to reduce the pressure for external storage and\\nboost the burstiness of modern I/O systems. The DMSH has demonstrated its strength and potential in practice. However,\\neach layer of DMSH is an independent heterogeneous system and data movement among more layers is significantly more\\ncomplex even without considering heterogeneity. How to efficiently utilize the DMSH is a subject of research facing the HPC\\ncommunity. Further, accessing data with a high-throughput and low-latency is more imperative than ever. Data prefetching\\nis a well-known technique for hiding read latency by requesting data before it is needed to move it from a high-latency medium\\n(e.g., disk) to a low-latency one (e.g., main memory). However, existing solutions do not consider the new deep memory and\\nstorage hierarchy and also suffer from under-utilization of prefetching resources and unnecessary evictions. Additionally,\\nexisting approaches implement a client-pull model where understanding the application\'s I/O behavior drives prefetching\\ndecisions. Moving towards exascale, where machines run multiple applications concurrently by accessing files in a workflow, a\\nmore data-centric approach resolves challenges such as cache pollution and redundancy. In this paper, we present the design\\nand implementation of Hermes: a new, heterogeneous-aware, multi-tiered, dynamic, and distributed I/O buffering system.\\nHermes enables, manages, supervises, and, in some sense, extends I/O buffering to fully integrate into the DMSH. We\\nintroduce three novel data placement policies to efficiently utilize all layers and we present three novel techniques to perform\\nmemory, metadata, and communication management in hierarchical buffering systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the\\nbenefits of a truly hierarchical data prefetcher that adopts a server-push approach to data prefetching. Our evaluation\\nshows that, in addition to automatic data movement through the hierarchy, Hermes can significantly accelerate I/O and\\noutperforms by more than 2x state-of-the-art buffering platforms. Lastly, results show 10%-35% performance gains over\\nexisting prefetchers and over 50% when compared to systems with no prefetching.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","X.-H.
