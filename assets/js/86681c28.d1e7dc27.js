Big data has led to new types\\nof storage. The predominant data model in cloud storage is the\\nobject-based storage and it is highly successful. Object stores\\nfollow a simpler API with get() and put() operations to interact\\nwith the data. A wide variety of data analysis software have\\nbeen developed around objects using their APIs. However, object\\nstorage and traditional file storage are designed for different\\npurpose and for different applications. Organizations maintain\\nfile-based storage clusters and a high volume of existing data are\\nstored in files. Moreover, many new applications need to access\\ndata from both types of storage. In this paper, we first explore\\nthe key differences between object-based and the more traditional\\nfile-based storage systems. We have designed and implemented\\nseveral file-to-object mapping algorithms to bridge the semantic\\ngap between these data models. Our evaluation shows that by\\nachieving an efficient such mapping, our library can grant 2x-\\n27x higher performance against a naive one-to-one mapping and\\nwith minimal overheads. Our study exposes various strengths and\\nweaknesses of each mapping strategy and frames the extended\\npotential of a unified data access system.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","X.-H.
