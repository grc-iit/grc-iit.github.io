How to support mobility\\nfor legacy codes, however, is still an issue of research.\\nThe key to solve this outstanding issue is the support of\\nheterogeneous process migration. During the last few\\nyears, we have successfully developed mechanisms to\\nsupport heterogeneous process migration of legacy codes\\nwritten in C, C++, and Fortran. We present in this paper\\nthe design of the High Performance Computing Mobility\\n(HPCM) middleware,\\nthe\\ndevelopment and\\nimplementation of its key components, pre-compiler and\\nits static libraries. Due to the similarity between process\\nmigration and checkpointing, the pre-compiler not only\\nmakes automatic process migration of legacy codes\\nfeasible, but also supports dynamic heterogeneous\\ncheckpointing. We perform a set of tests and compare\\nexperimental results with Porch, a well-known portable\\nheterogeneous checkpointing system. The experimental\\nresults show that our methods are feasible, efficient and\\nvery promising.","authors":["C. Du","X.-H. Sun","K.
