We\\ndiscuss the needs for such services, our early research efforts in\\nthis direction which lead to prototyping certain benchmark ser-\\nvices, and the current state of work in this area. We demonstrate\\nthe feasibility of the architecture by focusing on services which in-\\nvolve wireline PSTN as well as the wireless aspects (2 G, 2.5 G) of\\nthe PSTN. Our methodology is attractive since it keeps each of the\\ndomains (PSTN and Internet) unaware as to where the service is\\nexecuting with respect to which domain actually requested the ser-\\nvice. Individual entities participating in the service do not have any\\nknowledge that external entities from another domain also con-\\ntributed in the execution and fulfillment of such services. Our ap-\\nproach, as embodied in the service architecture, is to leverage the\\nbest of the Internet protocols (SIP, XML, HTTP) and technologies\\n(instant messaging, presence) to provide a general framework for\\npersonalized service specification and execution.","authors":["V.
