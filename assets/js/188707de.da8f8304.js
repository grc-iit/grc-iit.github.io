In this paper, we propose a pattern-directed and layout-aware\\ndata replication design, named PDLA, to improve the performance of parallel I/O systems. PDLA includes an HDD-based scheme\\nH-PDLA and an SSD-based scheme S-PDLA. For applications with relatively low I/O concurrency, H-PDLA identifies access patterns\\nof applications and makes a reorganized data replica for each access pattern on HDD-based servers with an optimized data layout.\\nMoreover, to accommodate applications with high I/O concurrency, S-PDLA replicates critical access patterns that can bring\\nperformance benefits on SSD-based servers or on HDD-based and SSD-based servers. We have implemented the proposed\\nreplication scheme under MPICH2 library on top of OrangeFS file system. Experimental results show that H-PDLA can significantly\\nimprove the original parallel I/O system performance and demonstrate the advantages of S-PDLA over H-PDLA.","authors":["S. He","Y.
