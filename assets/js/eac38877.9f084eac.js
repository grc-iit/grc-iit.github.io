Compared to current frameworks, Horizon\\nextends the scope of computation by exposing two notions usually\\nrelegated to implementations: graph data models and communica-\\ntion models. Horizon can reduce execution time by an average of\\n5.3\xd7 across different applications and datasets and process an order\\nof magnitude larger graphs when compared to the state of the art.","authors":["A.
