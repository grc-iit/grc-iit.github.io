The poor\\nI/O performance has been attributed as a critical\\ncause of the low sustained performance of paral-\\nlel computing systems. In this study, we propose a\\ndata layout-aware optimization strategy to promote\\na better integration of the parallel I/O middleware\\nand parallel file systems, two major components of\\nthe current parallel I/O systems, and to improve the\\ndata access performance. We explore the layout-aware\\noptimization in both independent I/O and collective\\nI/O, two primary forms of I/O in parallel applications.\\nWe illustrate that the layout-aware I/O optimization\\ncould improve the performance of current parallel\\nI/O strategy effectively. The experimental results verify\\nthat the proposed strategy could improve parallel I/O\\nperformance by nearly 40% on average. The proposed\\nlayout-aware parallel I/O has a promising potential in\\nimproving the I/O performance of parallel systems.","authors":["Y. Chen","X.-H. Sun","R. Thakur","H. Song","H.
