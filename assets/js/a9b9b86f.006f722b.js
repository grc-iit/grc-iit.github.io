In this paper the generalized speedup and\\nits relation with other existing performance metrics, such as tra-\\nditional speedup, efficiency, scalability, etc., are carefully studied.\\nIn terms of the introduced asymptotic speed, we show that the\\ndifference between the generalized speedup and the traditional\\nspeedup lies in the definition of the efficiency of uniprocessor\\nprocessing, which is a very important issue in shared virtual\\nmemory machines. A scientific application has been implemented\\non a KSR-1 parallel computer. Experimental and theoretical re-\\nsults show that the generalized speedup is distinct from the tradi-\\ntional speedup and provides a more reasonable measurement. In\\nthe study of different speedups, an interesting relation between\\nfixed-time and memory-bounded speedup is revealed. Various\\ncauses of superlinear speedup are also presented.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","J.
