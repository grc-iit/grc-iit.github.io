With hardware and/or software support, data\\nprefetching brings data closer to a processor before it is actually needed. Many prefetching techniques have been developed\\nfor single-core processors. Recent developments in processor technology have brought multicore processors into mainstream.\\nWhile some of the single-core prefetching techniques are directly applicable to multicore processors, numerous novel strategies\\nhave been proposed in the past few years to take advantage of multiple cores. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive\\nreview of the state-of-the-art prefetching techniques, and proposes a taxonomy that classifies various design concerns in\\ndeveloping a prefetching strategy, especially for multicore processors. We compare various existing methods through analysis\\nas well.","authors":["S. Byna","Y. Chen","X.-H.
