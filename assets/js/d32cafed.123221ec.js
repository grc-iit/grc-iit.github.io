However, current analysis tools, which often use data\\ndrilling techniques (iterative exploration for deeper insights), treat\\nevery query independently and do not optimize column data for\\ndata-slicing (extracting specific data subsets), resulting in subpar\\nquerying performance. In this paper, we designed IOMax, a tool\\nfor efficient data drilling analysis on large-scale I/O traces. IOMax\\nutilizes a novel query optimization technique to improve the query\\nperformance by 8.6x while reducing the memory footprint required\\nfor analysis by 11x. Additionally, it employs data transformation\\ntechniques to improve data-slicing performance by up to 11.4x. In\\nconclusion, IOMax optimizes I/O analysis for scientific workflows\\non the Lassen supercomputer, resulting in up to 7x improvement.","authors":["I. Yildirim","H. Devarajan","A. Kougkas","X.-H.
