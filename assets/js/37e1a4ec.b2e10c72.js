In this work, we\\nexplore how patterns of I/O within these applications can signif-\\nicantly affect the effectiveness of the underlying storage systems\\nand how these same patterns can be utilized to improve many as-\\npects of the I/O stack and mitigate the I/O bottleneck. We offer\\nthree main contributions in this paper. First, we develop and eval-\\nuate algorithms by which I/O patterns can be efficiently discovered\\nand described. Second, we implement one such algorithm to re-\\nduce the metadata quantity in a virtual parallel file system by up to\\nseveral orders of magnitude, thereby increasing the performance of\\nwrites and reads by up to 40 and 480 percent respectively. Third,\\nwe build a prototype file system with pattern-aware prefetching and\\nevaluate it to show a 46 percent reduction in I/O latency. Finally,\\nwe believe that efficient pattern discovery and description, coupled\\nwith the observed predictability of complex patterns within many\\nhigh-performance applications, offers significant potential to en-\\nable many additional I/O optimizations.","authors":["J.
