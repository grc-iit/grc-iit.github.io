Which workload to offload and how\\nto offload it to PIM logic determine whether the PIM architecture\\nis well utilized. Offloading too much or too little workload\\nfrom the host processor to the PIM side could hurt overall\\nperformance. On the other hand, the offloading granularity\\nneeds to be representative without losing generality. In this\\npaper, we present CoPIM, a novel PIM workload offloading\\narchitecture that can dynamically determine which portion of the\\ngraph workload can benefit more from PIM-side computation.\\nCOPIM focuses on the loop code blocks of graph applications\\nand evaluates the necessity of offloading based on a concurrent\\nmemory access model. We also provide detailed architectural\\ndesigns to support the offloading. In this way, CoPIM reduces\\nthe size of offloading instructions and also improves the overall\\nperformance with less energy consumption. The experimental\\nresults show that compared with other state-of-the-art PIM\\nworkload offloading frameworks, CoPIM achieves a speedup\\nby the geometric mean of 19.5% and 11.4% than PEI and\\nGraphPIM, respectively. On the other hand, CoPIM also reduces\\nthe un-core energy consumption by 6.8% and 6.5% on average\\nover PEI and GraphPIM, respectively.","authors":["L. Yan","M. Zhang","R. Wang","X. Chen","X.
