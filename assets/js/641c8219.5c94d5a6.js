Their\\napplicability depends on the availability of the underlying\\nnetwork bandwidth. However, network resources are\\nshared and the available network bandwidth varies with\\ntime. There is no satisfactory solution available for\\nnetwork performance predictions. This lack of prediction\\nlimits the applicability of network-based computing,\\nespecially for Grid computing where concurrent remote\\nprocessing is essential. In this study, we propose an\\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach for\\nnetwork performance prediction. The ANN mechanism\\nhas been tested on classical trace files and compared with\\nthe well-known system NWS (Network Weather Service)\\nfor performance. Experimental results show the ANN\\napproach always provides an improved prediction over\\nthat of NWS. ANN has a real potential in network\\ncomputing.","authors":["A. Eswaradass","X.-H. Sun","M.
