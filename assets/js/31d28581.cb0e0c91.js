Most of the existing approaches focus on server performance or application I/O pattern heterogeneity\\nin data placement. H2DP considers three axes of heterogeneity: server performance, server space, and application I/O pattern. More\\nspecifically, H2DP determines the optimized stripe sizes on servers based on server performance, keeps only critical data on all hybrid\\nservers and the rest data on HDD servers, and dynamically migrates data among different types of servers at run-time. This holistic\\nheterogeneity-awareness enables H2DP to achieve high performance by alleviating server load imbalance, efficiently utilizing SSD\\nspace, and accommodating application pattern variation. We have implemented a prototype of H2DP under MPICH2 atop OrangeFS.\\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that H2DP significantly improve I/O system performance compared to existing data\\nplacement schemes.","authors":["S.
