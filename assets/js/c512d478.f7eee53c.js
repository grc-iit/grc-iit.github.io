However, they are rarely used in HPC systems,\\nwhere parallel file systems (PFS) are the dominant storage\\nsystems. In this study, we carefully examine the architecture\\ndifference and performance characteristics of PFS and KVStore.\\nWe propose that it is valuable to utilize KVStore to optimize\\nthe overall I/O performance, especially for the workloads that\\nPFS cannot handle well, such as the cases with hurtful data\\nsynchronization or heavy metadata operations. To verify this\\nproposal, we conducted comprehensive experiments with several\\nsynthetic benchmarks, an I/O benchmark, and a real application.\\nThe results show that our proposal is promising.","authors":["Y.
