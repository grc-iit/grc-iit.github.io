EIDD methods are globally non-iterative, non-overlapping\\ndomain decomposition methods which, when compared with Schwarz alternating algorithm\\nbased parabolic solvers, are computationally and communicationally efficient for each sim-\\nulation time step but suffer from time step size restrictions due to conditional stability or\\nconditional consistency. By adding a stabilization step to the EIDD methods, the SEIDD\\nmethods are freed from time step size restrictions while retaining EIDD\'s computational and\\ncommunicational efficiency for each time step, rendering them excellent candidates for large-\\nscale parallel simulations. Three algorithms of the SEIDD type are implemented, which are\\nexperimentally tested to show excellent stability, computation and communication efficien-\\ncies, and high parallel speedup and scalability.","authors":["Y.
