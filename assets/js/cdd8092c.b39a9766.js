Compared to tradi-\\ntional chip designs that lack the notion of memory concurrency\\nand memory capacity, C2-Bound model finds memory bound\\nfactors significantly impact the optimal number of cores as\\nwell as their optimal silicon area allocations, especially for\\ndata-intensive applications with a none parallelizable sequential\\nportion. Therefore, our model is valuable to the design of new\\ngeneration many-core architectures that target big data process-\\ning, where working sets are usually larger than conventional\\nscientific computing. These findings are evidenced by our detailed\\nsimulations, which show with C2-Bound the design space can be\\nnarrowed down significantly up to four orders of magnitude.\\nC2-Bound analytic results can be either used in reconfigurable\\nhardware environments or, by software designers, applied to\\nscheduling, partitioning, and allocating resources among diverse\\napplications.","authors":["Y.-H.
