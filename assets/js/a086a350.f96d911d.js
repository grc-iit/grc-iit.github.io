However, the\\ncurrent client-initiated prefetching strategies do not work\\nwell for applications with complex, non-contiguous data\\naccess patterns. While technology advances continue to\\nenlarge the gap between computing and data access\\nperformance, trading computing power for data access\\ndelay has become a natural choice. We propose a server-\\nbased data-push approach. In this server-push\\narchitecture, a dedicated server named Data Push Server\\n(DPS) initiates and proactively pushes data closer to the\\nclient in time. We present the DPS architecture and study\\nthe issues such as what data to fetch, when to fetch, how\\nto push, and data access modeling.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","S. Byna","Y.
