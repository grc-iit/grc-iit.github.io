This has made the technology compelling as\\nan expansion to main memory. Rethinking PMEM as storage\\ndevices can offer a high performance buffering layer for HPC\\napplications to temporarily, but safely store data. However,\\nmodern parallel I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and pNetCDF, are\\ncomplicated and introduce significant software and metadata\\noverheads when persisting data to these storage devices, wasting\\nmuch of their potential. In this work, we explore the potential\\nof PMEM as storage through pMEMCPY: a simple, lightweight,\\nand portable I/O library for storing data in persistent memory.\\nWe demonstrate that our approach is up to 2x faster than other\\npopular parallel I/O libraries under real workloads.","authors":["L.
