Evaluating and understanding memory\\nsystem performance is increasingly becoming the core of high-end computing. Conventional memory metrics, such as miss ratio, AMAT,\\netc., are designed to measure a given memory performance parameter, and do not reflect the overall performance or complexity of a\\nmodern memory system. On the other hand, widely used system-performance metrics, such as IPC, are designed to measure CPU\\nperformance, and do not directly reflect memory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel memory metric called Access Per Cycle\\n(APC), which is the number of data accesses per cycle, to measure the overall memory performance with respect to the complexity of\\nmodern memory systems. A unique contribution of APC is its separation of memory evaluation from CPU evaluation; therefore, it provides\\na quantitative measurement of the \\"data-intensiveness\\" of an application. Simulation results show that the memory performance measured\\nby APC captures the concurrency complexity of modern memory systems, while other metrics cannot. APC is simple, effective, and is\\nsignificantly more appropriate than existing memory metrics in evaluating modern memory systems.","authors":["D. Wang","X.-H.
