Deep learning has\\nbeen applied to a broad spectrum of scientific domains such\\nas cosmology, particle physics, computer vision, fusion, and\\nastrophysics. Scientists have performed a great deal of work\\nto optimize the computational performance of deep learning\\nframeworks. However, the same cannot be said for I/O perfor-\\nmance. As deep learning algorithms rely on big-data volume and\\nvariety to effectively train neural networks accurately, I/O is\\na significant bottleneck on large-scale distributed deep learning\\ntraining. This study aims to provide a detailed investigation of\\nthe I/O behavior of various scientific deep learning workloads\\nrunning on the Theta supercomputer at Argonne Leadership\\nComputing Facility. In this paper, we present DLIO, a novel\\nrepresentative benchmark suite built based on the I/O profiling\\nof the selected workloads. DLIO can be utilized to accurately\\nemulate the I/O behavior of modern scientific deep learning\\napplications. Using DLIO, application developers and system\\nsoftware solution architects can identify potential I/O bottlenecks\\nin their applications and guide optimizations to boost the I/O\\nperformance leading to lower training times by up to 6.7x.","authors":["H.
