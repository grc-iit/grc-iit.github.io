The key\\nto reducing data access delay in system design is to diminish data stall time. Memory locality and concurrency are the two\\nessential factors influencing the performance of modern memory systems. However, existing studies in reducing data stall\\ntime rarely focus on utilizing data access concurrency because the impact of memory concurrency on overall memory system\\nperformance is not well understood. In this study, a pair of novel data stall time models, the L-C model for the combined\\neffort of locality and concurrency and the P-M model for the effect of pure miss on data stall time, are presented. The\\nmodels provide a new understanding of data access delay and provide new directions for performance optimization. Based\\non these new models, a summary table of advanced cache optimizations is presented. It has 38 entries contributed by data\\nconcurrency while only has 21 entries contributed by data locality, which shows the value of data concurrency. The L-C and\\nP-M models and their associated results and opportunities introduced in this study are important and necessary for future\\ndata-centric architecture and algorithm design of modern computing systems.","authors":["Y.
