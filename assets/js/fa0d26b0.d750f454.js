Recent studies rely on extensive\\nset intersections on static bipartite graphs to solve the MBE\\nproblem. However, the computational subgraphs dynamically\\nchange during enumeration, leading to redundant memory ac-\\ncesses and degraded set intersection performance. To overcome\\nthis limitation, we propose an AdaMBE algorithm. First, we\\nredesign its core operations using local neighborhood information\\nderived from computational subgraphs to minimize redundant\\nmemory accesses. Second, we dynamically create computational\\nsubgraphs using bitmaps leveraging its fast bitwise operations\\nto accelerate set intersections. Finally, we integrate them in\\nAdaMBE. Our experimental results show that AdaMBE is\\n1.6x-49.7\xd7 faster than its closest CPU-based competitor and\\nsuccessfully enumerates all 19 billion maximal bicliques on the\\nTVTropes dataset, a large task beyond the capabilities of existing\\nalgorithms. Notably, on certain datasets, our parallel version,\\nParAdaMBE, on CPUs even outperforms GMBE on GPUs by\\nup to 5.07x.\\nIndex Terms-Bipartite graph, maximal biclique enumeration,\\nbitmap","authors":["Z.
