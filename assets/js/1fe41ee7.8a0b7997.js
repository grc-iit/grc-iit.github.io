SpMM involves massive irregular memory\\naccesses and poses great challenges to conventional cache-\\nbased computer architectures. Recently dedicated SpMM\\naccelerators have been proposed to enhance SpMM per-\\nformance. However, current SpMM accelerators still face\\nchallenges in adapting to varied sparse patterns, fully ex-\\nploiting inherent parallelism, and optimizing cache perfor-\\nmance. To address these issues, we introduce ACES, a novel\\nSpMM accelerator in this study. First, ACES features an\\nadaptive execution flow that dynamically adjusts to diverse\\nsparse patterns. The adaptive execution flow balances par-\\nallel computing efficiency and data reuse. Second, ACES\\nincorporates locality-concurrency co-optimizations within\\nthe global cache. ACES utilizes a concurrency-aware cache\\nmanagement policy, which considers data locality and con-\\ncurrency for optimal replacement decisions. Additionally, the\\nintegration of a non-blocking buffer with the global cache en-\\nhances concurrency and reduces computational stalls. Third,\\nthe hardware architecture of ACES is designed to integrate\\nall innovations. The architecture ensures efficient support\\nacross the adaptive execution flow, advanced cache opti-\\nmizations, and fine-grained parallel processing. Our perfor-\\nmance evaluation demonstrates that ACES significantly out-\\nperforms existing solutions, providing a 2.1\xd7 speedup and\\nmarking a substantial advancement in SpMM acceleration.","authors":["X.
