I/O prefetching is an effective solution for masking the\\nlatency. Most of existing I/O prefetching techniques, however, are\\nconservative and their effectiveness is limited by low accuracy\\nand coverage. As the processor-I/O performance gap has been\\nincreasing rapidly, data-access delay has become a dominant per-\\nformance bottleneck. We argue that it is time to revisit the \\"I/O\\nwall\\" problem and trade the excessive computing power with\\ndata-access speed. We propose a novel pre-execution approach\\nfor masking I/O latency. We describe the pre-execution I/O\\nprefetching framework, the pre-execution thread construction\\nmethodology, the underlying library support, and the proto-\\ntype implementation in the ROMIO MPI-IO implementation in\\nMPICH2. Preliminary experiments show that the pre-execution\\napproach is promising in reducing I/O access latency and has\\nreal potential.","authors":["Y. Chen","S. Byna","X.-H. Sun","R. Thakur","W. D.
