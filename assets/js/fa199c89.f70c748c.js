PFSs favor large\\nrequests, and do not work well for small requests, especially\\nsmall random requests. Newer Solid State Drives (SSD) have\\nexcellent performance on small random data accesses, but also\\nincur a high monetary cost. In this study, we propose a hybrid\\narchitecture named the Smart Selective SSD Cache (S4D-Cache),\\nwhich employs a small set of SSD-based file servers as a selective\\ncache of conventional HDD-based file servers. A novel scheme\\nis introduced to identify performance-critical data, and conduct\\nselective cache admission to fully utilize the hybrid architecture\\nin terms of data-access parallelism and randomness. We have\\nimplemented an S4D-Cache under the MPI-IO and PVFS2\\nparallel file system. Our experiments show that S4D-Cache\\ncan significantly improve I/O throughput, and is a promising\\napproach for parallel applications.","authors":["S. He","X.-H. Sun","B.
