Evaluating and\\nunderstanding memory system performance is increasingly\\nbecoming the core of high-end computing. Conventional memory\\nmetrics, such as miss ratio, average miss latency, average memory\\naccess time, etc., are designed to measure a given memory\\nperformance parameter, and do not reflect the overall performance\\nof a memory system. On the other hand, widely used system\\nperformance metrics, such as IPC and Flops are designed to\\nmeasure CPU performance, and are not appropriate for memory\\nperformance. In this study, we propose a novel memory metric,\\nAccess Per Cycle (APC), to measure overall memory performance\\nwith consideration of the complexity of modern memory systems.\\nA unique contribution of APC is its separation of memory\\nevaluation from CPU evaluation. Simulation results show that\\nAPC is significantly more appropriate than existing memory\\nmetrics in evaluating modern memory systems.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","D.
