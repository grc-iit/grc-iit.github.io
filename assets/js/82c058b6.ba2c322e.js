With the merits of simplicity and efficiency, 2-dimensional (2-D) mesh has been a popular choice of large MIMD interconnection networks. Mesh, however, has its known weaknesses in scalability and connectivity. Packed Exponential Connections (PEC) is a newly proposed network which is designed to improve the scalability and connectivity of 2-D mesh while maintaining its merits. In this study, the performance of PEC over mesh network is carefully examined through computer simulation. Characteristics of PEC networks are revealed. A novel routing scheme is proposed and used in PROTEUS environment to simulate the performance of 2-D PEC network. Simulation and analytical results show that for many applications where non-local communications are required, PEC network provides superior performance to that of mesh. Based on simulation results, structural modification is also suggested to further enhance the performance of PEC network. 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.","authors":["X.
