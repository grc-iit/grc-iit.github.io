However, while a network of workstations may be readily available, these workstations may be privately owned and the\\nowners may not want others to interrupt their priority in using the computer. Assuming machine owners have a preemptive priority, in\\nthis paper, we study the parallel processing capacity of a privately owned network of workstations. A mathematical model is developed\\nto predict performance for nondedicated network computing. It also considers systems with heterogeneous machine utilization and\\nheterogeneous service distribution. This model separates the influence of machine utilization, sequential job service rate, and parallel\\ntask allocation on the parallel completion time. It is simple and valuable for guiding task scheduling in a nondedicated environment.","authors":["L. Gong","X.-H. Sun","E.
