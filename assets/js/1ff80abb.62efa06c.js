In this research, we\\npresent an analytical study to estimate execution time in the\\npresence of failures of directed acyclic graph (DAG) based\\nScientific Applications and provide a guideline for performance\\noptimization. The study is four fold. We first introduce a\\nperformance model to predict individual subtask computation\\ntime under failures. Next, a layered, iterative approach is\\nadopted to transform a DAG into a layered DAG, which reflects\\nfull dependencies among all the subtasks. Then, the expected\\nexecution time under failures of the DAG is derived based on\\nstochastic analysis. Unlike existing models, this newly proposed\\nperformance model provides both the variance and distribution.\\nIt is practical and can be put to real use. Finally, based on the\\nmodel, performance optimization, weak point identification and\\nenhancement are proposed. Intensive simulations are conducted\\nto verify the analytical findings. They show that the newly\\nproposed model and weak point enhancement mechanism work\\nwell.","authors":["H. Jin","X.-H. Sun","Z. Zheng","Z. Lan","B.
