In this study, we put forward a\\nnovel performance model for non-dedicated network\\ncomputing. Based on this model, a performance prediction\\nand task scheduling system called Grid Harvest Service\\n(GHS), has been designed and implemented. GHS consists\\nof a performance measurement component, a prediction\\ncomponent and a scheduling component. Different\\nscheduling algorithms are proposed for different\\nsituations. Experimental results show that the GHS system\\nprovides satisfactory solution for performance prediction\\nand scheduling of large applications and that GHS has a\\nreal potential.\\nKeywords: performance prediction and measurement,\\ntask scheduling, resources sharing, grid computing,\\nperformance modeling","authors":["X.-H.
