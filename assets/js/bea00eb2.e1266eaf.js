Nowa-\\ndays, high-performance computing (HPC) system designers\\nare considering using fat-tree as the interconnection network\\nfor the next generation supercomputers. For extreme-scale\\ncomputing systems like the data centers and supercomput-\\ners, the performance is highly dependent on the intercon-\\nnection networks. In this paper, we present Fat TreeSim, a\\nPDES-based toolkit consisting of a highly scalable fat-tree\\nnetwork model, with the goal of better understanding the de-\\nsign constraints of fat-tree networking architectures in data\\ncenters and HPC systems, as well as evaluating the applica-\\ntions running on top of the network. Fat TreeSim is designed\\nto model and simulate large-scale fat-tree networks up to\\nmillions of nodes with protocol-level fidelity. We have con-\\nducted extensive experiments to validate and demonstrate\\nthe accuracy, scalability and usability of Fat TreeSim. On\\nArgonne Leadership Computing Facility\'s Blue Gene/Qsys-\\ntem, Mira, Fat TreeSim is capable of achieving a peak event\\nrate of 305 M/s for a 524,288-node fat-tree model with a\\ntotal of 567 billion committed events. The strong scaling\\nexperiments use up to 32,768 cores and show a near linear\\nscalability. Comparing with a small-scale physical system\\nin Emulab, Fat TreeSim can accurately model the latency in\\nthe same fat-tree network with less than 10% error rate for\\nmost cases. Finally, we demonstrate Fat TreeSim\'s usability\\nthrough a case study in which Fat TreeSim serves as the net-\\nwork module of the YARNsim system, and the error rates\\nfor all test cases are less than 13.7%.","authors":["N.
