Grid computing infrastructure, on the other hand, is a shared\\ncollaborative environment constructed on virtual organizations. Each organization has its own resource management policy and usage pattern.\\nThe non-dedicated characteristic of Grid computing prevents the leverage of conventional performance evaluation systems. In this study, we\\nintroduce the grid harvest service (GHS) performance evaluation and task scheduling system for solving large-scale applications in a shared\\nenvironment. GHS is based on a novel performance prediction model and a set of task scheduling algorithms. GHS supports three classes\\nof task scheduling, single task, parallel processing and meta-task. Experimental results show that GHS provides a satisfactory solution for\\nperformance prediction and task scheduling of large applications and has a real potential.\\n\xa92006 Elsevier Inc.
