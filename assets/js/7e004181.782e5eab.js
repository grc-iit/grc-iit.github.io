This study describes\\nan I/O data replication scheme, named Pattern-Direct and\\nLayout-Aware (PDLA) data replication scheme, to alleviate\\nthis performance gap. The basic idea of PDLA is replicating\\nidentified data access pattern, and saving these reorganized\\nreplications with optimized data layouts based on access cost\\nanalysis. A runtime system is designed and developed to\\nintegrate the PDLA replication scheme and existing parallel\\nI/O system; a prototype of PDLA is implemented under the\\nMPICH2 and PVFS2 environments. Experimental results show\\nthat PDLA is effective in improving data access performance\\nof parallel I/O systems.","authors":["Y. Yin","J. Li","J. He","X.-H. Sun","R.
