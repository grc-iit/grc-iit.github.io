This\\npaper presents algorithms for data communication and migration protocols to support\\ncommunication state transfer in a dynamic, distributed parallel environment. These\\nalgorithms collectively preserve the semantics of the communication and support com-\\nmunication state transfer. The assumptions and validity of our solution are discussed\\nand analyzed. Based on our early results in process migration, we implement a proto-\\ntype system for process state transfer. Experimental results confirm our design is valid\\nand has a true potential in practice.","authors":["K. Chanchio","X.-H.
