In this study we introduce a data model, the Mem-\\nory Space Representation (MSR) model, to recognize com-\\nplex data structures in program address spaces. Support-\\ning mechanisms of the MSR model are also developed for\\ncollecting program data structures and restoring them in a\\nheterogeneous environment. The MSR design has been im-\\nplemented under a prototype heterogeneous process migra-\\ntion environment. Pointer-intensive programs with function\\nand recursion calls are tested. Experimental results confirm\\nthat the newly proposed design is feasible and effective for\\nheterogeneous network process migration.","authors":["K. Chanchio","X.-H.
