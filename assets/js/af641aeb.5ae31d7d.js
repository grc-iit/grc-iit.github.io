In particular, given a stream of requests to a shared data\\nitem with respect to a homogeneous cost model, we first propose a fast off-line algorithm using dynamic programming techniques,\\nwhich can generate an optimal schedule within O(mn) time-space complexity by using cache, migration as well as replication to serve a\\nn-length request sequence in a m-node network, substantially improving the previous results. Furthermore, we also study the online\\nform of this problem, and present an 3-competitive online algorithm by leveraging an idea of anticipatory caching. The algorithm can\\nserve an online request in constant time and is space efficient in O(m) as well, rendering it more practical in reality. We evaluate our\\nalgorithms, together with some variants, by conducting extensive simulation studies. Our results show that the optimal cost of the\\noff-line algorithm is changed in a parabolic form as the ratio of caching cost to transfer cost is increased, and the online algorithm is less\\nthan 2 times worse in most cases than its optimal off-line counterpart.","authors":["Y.
