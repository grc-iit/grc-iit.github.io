Because I/O\\naccesses account for a large portion of the execution time\\nfor data intensive applications, energy-aware parallel I/O\\nsubsystems are critical for addressing challenges related to\\nHPC energy efficiency. In this paper, we present an energy-\\nconscious parallel I/O middleware approach that combines\\nruntime I/O access interception and Dynamic Voltage and\\nFrequency Scaling capability available on modern processors to\\nintelligently schedule the system\'s power-performance mode for\\nenergy savings. We implement this approach into SERA-IO, an\\nMPI-IO based middleware to enable energy consciousness for\\nI/O intensive applications. Experimental evaluations conducted\\non real systems using multiple parallel I/O benchmarks show\\nthat SERA-IO can reduce system energy by 9% to 28% without\\ndecreasing application performance. With the emerging of\\nlarge-scale data intensive applications and ever larger and\\nmore complex parallel computing systems, intelligent, energy\\nconscious software and runtime systems such as SERA-IO are\\ncritical for the success of future high-end computing.","authors":["R.
