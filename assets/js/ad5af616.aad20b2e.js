Exploiting this complex infrastructure requires \\nefficient middleware to support the execution of a \\ndistributed application, composed of a set of subtasks, for \\nbest performance. This presents the challenge how to \\nschedule these subtasks in shared heterogeneous systems. \\nCurrent work has several limitations. Most scheduling \\nsystems are based on determined estimation of task \\ncompletion time. Current application-level scheduling \\nalgorithms are too closely coupled with application \\ninternal structures. The application performance may \\nsuffer when some resources represent abnormal usage \\npattern during applications execution. To address these \\nissues, we develop a prototype of Grid Harvest Service \\n(GHS) to provide dynamic and self-adaptive task \\nscheduling. Experimental results show GHS outperforms \\ncurrent systems in scheduling large applications in a non dedicated heterogeneous environment.","authors":["M. Wu","X.-H.
