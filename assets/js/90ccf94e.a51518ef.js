The gap is further exacerbated recently because appli-\\ncations are becoming more data-intensive in both industry and\\nacademia. Traditional storage devices, such as hard disk drives\\n(HDD), fail to keep up with the paces of this growth. A known\\nsolution is to use solid state drives (SSD) as fast storage. Due to\\nhigh cost of SSD, data and supercomputing centers usually adopt\\na hybrid storage system, which consists of a combination of HDD\\nand SSD I/O servers. However, hybrid I/O and storage systems\\nhave increased the complexity, making SSD often underutilized.\\nThe configuration and utilization of HDD/SSD hybrid systems is a\\nlasting phenomenon. In this study, we propose a high performance\\nhybrid parallel I/O and storage simulator, HPIS3. As a co-design\\ntool, HPIS3 is capable of simulating a variety of parallel storage\\nsystems, especially under hybrid scenarios. The experimental\\nresults show that the lowest error rate is 2%, and the average is\\n11.98%.","authors":["B. Feng","N. Liu","S. He","X.-H.
