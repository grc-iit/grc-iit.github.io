PAC-PLRU not only utilizes but also judiciously\\nsalvages the prediction information discarded from a\\nwidely-adopted stride prefetcher. The main idea behind\\nPAC-PLRU is utilizing the prediction results generated by the\\nexisting stride prefetcher and preventing these predicted cache\\nblocks from being replaced in the near future. Experimental\\nresults show that leveraging the PAC-PLRU with a stride\\nprefetcher reduces the average L2 cache miss rate by 91% over\\na baseline system with only PLRU policy, and by 22% over a\\nsystem using PLRU with an unconnected stride prefetcher.\\nMost importantly, PAC-PLRU only requires minor\\nmodifications to existing cache architecture to get these\\nbenefits. The proposed PAC-PLRU policy is promising in\\nfostering the connection between prefetching and replacement\\npolicies, and have a lasting impact on improving the overall\\ncache performance.","authors":["K.
