Although extensive work has optimized the I/O\\nprocesses during the simulation phase, executing analytical\\nqueries-which often require iterative traversals of large files\\nfor insights-is cumbersome and usually constrained by low I/O\\nperformance. Instead of waiting for the analysis phase to process\\nqueries, quantities can be derived asynchronously during data\\nproduction and cached, speeding up future queries. In this\\nwork, we introduce a context-aware I/O layer named \'Hades.\' It\\nis designed to efficiently derive insights from selected quantities\\nwithout compromising overall workflow performance. Hades\\nactively and asynchronously computes and stores these quantities\\nwhile the data is in transit. Hades leverages a hierarchical\\nbuffering system with data access-aware prefetching to ensure\\nquick and timely access to relevant data. It offers a flexible\\nquery interface empowering users to easily define derived\\nquantities and provide control over data placement decisions.\\nHades is implemented using an Adios2 plugin engine and the\\nHermes buffering platform, enabling transparent use by any\\nAdios-powered application or workflow. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate performance improvements by up to 3-4x for tested\\nreal-world scientific producer-consumer workflows.\\nIndex Terms-Active Storage, Hierarchical Storage, Context\\nAwareness, Metadata Management, Data Operator, In-transit\\nComputing","authors":["J.
