These workflows\\nrequire a cohesive set of performance analysis tools to provide a\\ncomprehensive understanding of data exchange patterns in HPC\\nsystems. However, current tools are not designed to work with\\nan AI-based I/O software stack that requires tracing at multiple\\nlevels of the application. To this end, we developed a data flow\\ntracer called DFTracer to capture data-centric events from\\nworkflows and the I/O stack to build a detailed understanding\\nof the data exchange within AI-driven workflows. DFTracer has\\nthe following three novel features, including a unified interface\\nto capture trace data from different layers in the software stack,\\na trace format that is analysis-friendly and optimized to support\\nefficiently loading multi-million events in a few seconds, and the\\ncapability to tag events with workflow-specific context to perform\\ndomain-centric data flow analysis for workflows. Additionally,\\nwe demonstrate that DFTracer has a 1.44x smaller runtime\\noverhead and 1.3-7.1x smaller trace size than state-of-the-art\\ntracing tools such as Score-P, Recorder, and Darshan. Moreover,\\nwith AI-driven workflows, Score-P, Recorder, and Darshan\\ncannot find I/O accesses from dynamically spawned processes,\\nand their load performance of 100M events is three orders of\\nmagnitude slower than DFTracer. In conclusion, we demonstrate\\nthat DFTracer can capture multi-level performance data,\\nincluding contextual event tagging with a low overhead of 1-5%\\nfrom AI-driven workflows such as MuMMI and Microsoft\'s\\nMegatron Deepspeed running on large-scale HPC systems.\\nIndex Terms-deep learning, workflows, I/O, tracer, multi-\\nlevel, application apis, system calls, transparent, interception.","authors":["H.
