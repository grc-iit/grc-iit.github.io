Performance under failures\\nand its optimization become timely important issues facing\\nthe HPC community. In this study, we propose an analytical\\nmodel to predict the application performance. The model\\ncharacterizes the impact of coordinated checkpointing and\\nsystem failures on application performance, considering all the\\nfactors including workload, the number of nodes, failure arrival\\nrate, recovery cost, and checkpointing interval and overhead.\\nBased on the model, we gauge three parameters, the number\\nof compute nodes, checkpointing interval, and the number of\\nspare nodes to conduct a comprehensive study of performance\\noptimization under failures. Performance scalability under\\nfailures is also studied to explore the performance improvement\\nspace for different parameters. Experimental results from\\nboth synthetic and actual system failure logs confirm that the\\nproposed model and optimization methodologies are effective\\nand feasible.","authors":["H. Jin","Y.
