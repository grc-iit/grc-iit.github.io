Although data is often stored compressed,\\ncurrently Hadoop takes 49% longer to process compressed data\\ncompared to uncompressed data. Processing compressed data\\nreduces the amount of task parallelism and creates uneven\\nworkload distribution both of which are fundamental issues the\\nMapReduce parallel programming paradigm should alleviate. In\\nthis paper, we propose the design and implementation of a Net-\\nwork Overlapped Compression scheme, NOC, and Compression\\nAware Storage scheme, CAS. NOC reduces data load time and\\nhides compression overhead by interleaving network I/O with\\ncompression. CAS increases parallelism by dynamically changing\\na file\'s block size based on compression ratio. Additionally, we\\ndevelop a MapReduce Module which recognizes the characteris-\\ntics of compressed data to improve resource allocation and load\\nbalance. Collectively, NOC, CAS, and the MapReduce Module\\ndecrease job execution time on average by 66% and data load\\ntime by 31%.","authors":["A. Haider","X. Yang","N. Liu","S. He","X.-H.
