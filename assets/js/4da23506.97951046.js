This paper presents a set of data communication and process migration protocols to support\\ncommunication state transfer in a dynamic, distributed parallel environment. The protocols preserve the semantics of point-to-point\\ncommunication; they guarantee message delivery, maintain message ordering, and do not introduce deadlock when blocking send or\\nreceive operations are performed during process migration. Analytical proofs and prototype implementation are conducted to confirm\\nthe correctness of the protocols. Analytical and experimental results show the proposed design is valid and has a true potential in\\nnetwork computing.","authors":["K. Chanchio","X.-H.
