However, it is still very challenging to distribute\\nand analyze a huge amount of simulation results, which could be\\nover 100TB. One key reason is that typical Earth science data are\\nrepresented in NetCDF, which is not supported by the popular\\nand powerful Hadoop Distribute File System (HDFS) and\\nconsequently cannot be analyzed with tools based on HDFS. In\\nthis paper, we propose a Hadoop-based visualization and\\ndiagnosis framework for visualizing and analyzing Earth science\\ndata. It has a data model to transform data from the format of\\nNetCDF to CSV (Comma Separated Value) that is supported by\\nHDFS. With this model, data can be processed with the\\noperations such as maximize, sum, and subset through HIVE and\\nCloudera Impala and, therefore, typical diagnoses can be\\nperformed. In addition, the framework has a technique to\\nvisualize and diagnose HDFS-resident data with the popular\\nvisualization and diagnosis tool, IDL. To speed up this process, a\\nconcurrent reader is developed to obtain HDFS-resident data.\\nMoreover, a dynamic reader to transfer data from a parallel file\\nsystem (PFS) to HDFS is developed to efficiently visualize and\\ndiagnose PFS-resident data. The cloud resolve mode simulations\\nare used for testing and evaluating this framework.","authors":["S. Zhou","X. Yang","X. Li","T. Matsui","S. Liu","X.-H. Sun","W.
