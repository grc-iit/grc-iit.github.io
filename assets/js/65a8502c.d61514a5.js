Currently, there are\\ntwo principal networks for communications: the public\\nswitched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet. As\\nthese networks converge, new service\' ideas become\\napparent that are not possible in isolation on either of the\\nnetworks. This paper discusses how the merging of the\\nInternet and the (wireline- and wireless-) PSTN provides\\nfor an opportunity to transport the state of a PSTN phone\\ncall to the Internet for service execution. Our approach, as\\nembodied in the service architecture, is to leverage the\\nbest of the Internet protocols (SIP, XML, HTTP) and\\ntechnologies (instant messaging, presence) to provide a\\ngeneral framework for personalized service specification\\nand execution.","authors":["V.
