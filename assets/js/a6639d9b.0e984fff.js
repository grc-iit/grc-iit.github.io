Noticing that in real-world graphs, a small\\nportion of vertices occupy most connections, several techniques are proposed to\\nreorder vertices based on their access frequency for better data access locality.\\nHowever, these approaches can be further improved by identifying reordered data\\nmore effectively, which will reduce reordering overhead and improve overall\\nperformance. In this letter, we propose Learning-Based Reordering (LBR), a novel\\nlightweight framework that identifies and reorders hot data adaptively for given\\ngraphs, algorithms, and threads. Our experimental evaluation indicates that LBR\\ndecreases reordering overhead by 24.7% while improves performance by 9.9%\\ncompared to the best-performing existing scheme.","authors":["M. Zou","M.
