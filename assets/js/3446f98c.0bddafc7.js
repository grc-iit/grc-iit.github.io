Developers\\nuse data compression, a size-reduction technique, to address\\nthis issue. However, each compression library exhibits different\\nstrengths and weaknesses when considering the input data type\\nand format. We present Ares, an intelligent, adaptive, and\\nflexible compression framework which can dynamically choose a\\ncompression library for a given input data based on the type of\\nthe workload and provides an appropriate infrastructure to users\\nto fine-tune the chosen library. Ares is a modular framework\\nwhich unifies several compression libraries while allowing the\\naddition of more compression libraries by the user. Ares is a\\nunified compression engine that abstracts the complexity of using\\ndifferent compression libraries for each workload. Evaluation\\nresults show that under real-world applications, from both\\nscientific and Cloud domains, Ares performed 2-6x faster than\\ncompetitive solutions with a low cost of additional data analysis\\n(i.e., overheads around 10%) and up to 10x faster against a\\nbaseline of no compression at all.","authors":["H.
