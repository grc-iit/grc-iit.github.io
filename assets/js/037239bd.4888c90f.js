To\\nguide these decisions, this paper introduces data flow lifecycle anal-\\nysis. Workflows are commonly represented using directed acyclic\\ngraphs (DAGs). Data flow lifecycles (DFL) enrich task DAGs with\\ndata objects and properties that describe data flow and how tasks\\ninteract with that flow. Lifecycles enable analysis from several\\nimportant perspectives: task, data, and data flow. We describe rep-\\nresentation, measurement, analysis, visualization, and opportunity\\nidentification for DFLs. Our measurement is both distributed and\\nscalable, using space that is constant per data file. We use lifecycles\\nand opportunity analysis to reason about improved task placement\\nand reduced data movement for five scientific workflows with dif-\\nferent characteristics. Case studies show improvements of 15x, 1.9\xd7,\\nand 10-30x. Our work is implemented in the DataLife tool.","authors":["H. Lee","L. Guo","M. Tang","J. Firoz","N. Tallent","A. Kougkas","X.-H.
