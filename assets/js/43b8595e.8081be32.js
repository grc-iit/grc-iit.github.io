The poor I/O performance\\nhas been attributed as a critical cause of the low sustained\\nperformance of parallel systems. Collective I/O is widely\\nconsidered a critical solution that exploits the correlation\\namong I/O accesses from multiple processes of a parallel\\napplication and optimizes the I/O performance. However, the\\nconventional collective I/O strategy makes the optimization\\ndecision based on the logical file layout to avoid multiple file\\nsystem calls and does not take the physical data layout into\\nconsideration. On the other hand, the physical data layout in\\nfact decides the actual I/O access locality and concurrency. In\\nthis study, we propose a new collective I/O strategy that is\\naware of the underlying physical data layout. We confirm that\\nthe new Layout-Aware Collective I/O (LACIO) improves the\\nperformance of current parallel I/O systems effectively with\\nthe help of noncontiguous file system calls. It holds promise in\\nimproving the I/O performance for parallel systems.","authors":["Y. Chen","X.-H. Sun","R. Thakur","P. C. Roth","W. D.
