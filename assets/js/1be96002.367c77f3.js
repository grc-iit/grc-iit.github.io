Therefore, leaning and understanding data access\\nbehaviors is a must for effective data access optimizations.\\nModern microprocessors are equipped with hardware data\\nprefetchers, which predict data access patterns and prefetch data\\nfor CPU. However, memory systems in design do not have the\\ncapability to understand data access behaviors for performance\\noptimizations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, named\\nKNOWAC, to collect I/O information automatically through high-\\nlevel I/O libraries. KNOWAC accumulates I/O knowledge and\\nreveals data usage patterns by exploring the collected high-\\nlevel I/O characteristics. The discovered data usage patterns can\\nbe used for different I/O optimizations. We apply KNOWAC\\nto I/O prefetch under the framework of PnetCDF in this\\nstudy. Experimental results on a real-world application show\\nthat KNOWAC is promising and has a true practical value in\\nmitigating the I/O bottleneck.","authors":["J. He","X.-H. Sun","R.
