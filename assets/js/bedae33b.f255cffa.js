However, optimization process is usually a\\ndifficult task due to the complexity involved in understanding\\nI/O behavior. Tools that can help simplify the optimization\\nprocess have a significant importance. In this paper, we\\nintroduce a tool, called IOSIG, for providing a better\\nunderstanding of parallel I/O accesses and information to be\\nused for optimization techniques. The tool enables tracing\\nparallel I/O calls of an application and analyzing the collected\\ninformation to provide a clear understanding of I/O behavior\\nof the application. We show that performance overheads of the\\ntool in trace collection and analysis are negligible. The analysis\\nstep creates I/O signatures that various optimizations can use\\nfor improving I/O performance. I/O signatures are compact,\\neasy-to-understand,\\nand parameterized representations\\ncontaining data access pattern information such as size, strides\\nbetween consecutive accesses, repetition, timing, etc. The\\nsignatures include local I/O behavior for each process and\\nglobal behavior for an overall application. We illustrate the\\nusage of the IOSIG tool in data prefetching and data layout\\noptimizations.","authors":["Y. Yin","S. Byna","H. Song","X.-H. Sun","R.
