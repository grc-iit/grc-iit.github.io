The relative performance of different\\nparallel implementations varies with machine architecture, system and\\nproblem size. How to compare different implementations over a wide range\\nof machine architectures and problem sizes has not been well addressed due\\nto its difficulty. Scalability has been proposed in recent years to reveal scaling\\nproperties of parallel algorithms and machines. In this paper, the relation\\nbetween scalability and execution time is carefully studied. The concepts of\\ncrossing point analysis and range comparison are introduced. Crossing point\\nanalysis finds slow/fast performance crossing points of parallel algorithms\\nand machines. Range comparison compares performance over a wide range\\nof ensemble and problem size via scalability and crossing point analysis.\\nThree algorithms from scientific computing are implemented on an Intel\\nParagon and an IBM SP2 parallel computer. Experimental and theoretical\\nresults show how the combination of scalability, crossing point analysis, and\\nrange comparison provides a practical solution for scalable performance\\nevaluation and prediction. While our testings are conducted on homogeneous\\nparallel computers, the proposed methodology applies to heterogeneous and\\nnetwork computing as well. \xa92002 Elsevier Science (USA)\\nKey Words: parallel processing; performance evaluation and measurement;\\nscalability; execution time; numerical algorithms.","authors":["X.-H.
