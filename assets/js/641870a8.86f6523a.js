New models\\nof computing, such as business-on-demand, Web\\nservices, peer-to-peer networks, and Grid computing\\nhave emerged to harness distributed computing and\\nnetwork resources to provide powerful services. The\\nnon-deterministic characteristic of the resource\\navailability in these new computing platforms raises an\\noutstanding challenge: how to support Quality of\\nService (QoS) to meet a user\'s demand? In this study,\\nwe conduct a thorough study of QoS of distributed\\ncomputing, especially on Grid computing where the\\nrequirement of distributed sharing and coordination\\ngoes to the extreme. We start at QoS policies, and then\\nfocus on technical issues of the enforcement of the\\npolicies and performance optimization under each\\npolicy. This study provides a classification of existing\\nsoftware system based on their underlying policies, a\\nsystematic understanding of QoS, and a framework for\\nQoS of Grid computing.","authors":["X.-H.
