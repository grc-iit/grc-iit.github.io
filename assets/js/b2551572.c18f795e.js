In the meantime, many applications become more\\nand more data intensive. Data-access delay, not the processor speed, becomes the leading\\nperformance bottleneck of high-performance computing. Data prefetching is an effective\\nsolution to accelerating applications\' data access and bridging the growing gap between\\ncomputing speed and data-access speed. Existing works of prefetching, however, are very\\nconservative in general, due to the computing power consumption concern of the past.\\nThey suffer low effectiveness especially when applications\' access pattern changes. In this\\nstudy, we propose an Algorithm-level Feedback-controlled Adaptive (AFA) data prefetcher\\nto address these issues. The AFA prefetcher is based on the Data-Access History Cache, a\\nhardware structure that is specifically designed for data access acceleration. It provides\\nan algorithm-level adaptation and is capable of dynamically adapting to appropriate pre-\\nfetching algorithms at runtime. We have conducted extensive simulation testing with\\nthe SimpleScalar simulator to validate the design and to analyze the performance gain.\\nThe simulation results show that the AFA prefetcher is effective and achieves considerable\\nIPC (Instructions Per Cycle) improvement for 21 representative SPEC-CPU benchmarks.\\n\xa92012 Elsevier B.V.
