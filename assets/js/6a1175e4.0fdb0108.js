In recent years, the context-based data prefetching has received intensive attention because of its general applicability. In this study, we provide a preliminary analysis of the impact of orders on the effectiveness of the context-based prefetching. Motivated by the observations from the analytical results, we propose a new context-based prefetching method named Multi-Order Context-based (MOC) prefetching to adopt multi-order context analysis to increase the context-based prefetching effectiveness. We have carried out simulation testing with the SPEC-CPU2006 benchmarks via an enhanced CMP$im simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed MOC prefetching method outperforms the existing single-order prefetching and reduces the data-access latency effectively.","authors":["Y. Chen","H.
