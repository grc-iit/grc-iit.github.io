The needs of\\nboth HPC and big data technologies for advanced HPC and\\nbig data applications create a demand for integrated system\\nsupport. In this study, we introduce Scientific Data Processing\\n(SciDP) to support both HPC and big data applications via\\nintegrated scientific data processing. SciDP can directly process\\nscientific data stored on a Parallel File System (PFS), which\\nis typically deployed in an HPC environment, in a big data\\nprogramming environment running atop Hadoop Distributed File\\nSystem (HDFS). SciDP seamlessly integrates PFS, HDFS, and the\\nwidely-used R data analysis system to support highly efficient\\nprocessing of scientific data. It utilizes the merits of both PFS\\nand HDFS for fast data transfer, overlaps computing with\\ndata accessing, and integrates R into the data transfer process.\\nExperimental results show that SciDP accelerates analysis and\\nvisualization of a production NASA Center for Climate Simulation\\n(NCCS) climate and weather application by 6x to 8x when\\ncompared to existing solutions.","authors":["K.
