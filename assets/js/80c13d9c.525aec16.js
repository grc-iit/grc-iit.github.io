Although\\nthe increasing use of descriptive data formats (e.g., HDF5,\\nnetCDF) helps organize these datasets, it also introduces obscure\\nbottlenecks due to the need to translate high-level operations\\ninto file addresses and then into low-level I/O operations. To\\naddress this challenge, we introduce DaYu, a method and toolset\\nfor analyzing (a) semantic relationships between logical datasets\\nand file addresses, (b) how dataset operations translate into\\nI/O, and (c) the combination across entire workflows. DaYu\'s\\nanalysis and visualization enable the identification of critical\\nbottlenecks and the reasoning about remediation. We describe\\nour methodology and propose optimization guidelines. Evaluation\\non scientific workflows demonstrates up to a 3.7x performance\\nimprovement in I/O time for obscure bottlenecks. The time and\\nstorage overhead for DaYu\'s time-ordered data are typically\\nunder 0.2% of runtime and 0.25% of data volume, respectively.","authors":["M. Tang","J. Cernuda","J. Ye","L. Guo","N.
