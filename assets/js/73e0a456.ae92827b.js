New emerging solid state drives (SSD) are\\nable to deliver better performance but incur a high monetary\\ncost. While SSDs cannot always replace HDDs, the hybrid SSD-\\nHDD approach uniquely addresses common performance issues\\nin parallel I/O systems. The performance of hybrid SSD-HDD\\narchitecture depends on the utilization of the SSD and scheduling\\nof data placement. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware region-\\nlevel (CARL) data placement scheme for hybrid parallel I/O\\nsystems. CARL divides large files into several small regions,\\ncalculates the region costs according to the data access patterns,\\nand selectively places regions with high access costs onto the SSD-\\nbased file servers. We have implemented CARL under MPI-IO\\nand the PVFS2 parallel file system environment. Experimental\\nresults of representative benchmarks show that CARL is both\\nfeasible and able to improve I/O performance significantly.","authors":["S. He","X.-H. Sun","B. Feng","X. Huang","K.
