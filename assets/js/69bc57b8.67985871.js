On one hand, processors have\\nmore cores. On the other hand, I/O systems have become more\\ncomplex. Intensive research has been conducted on\\nmulti/many-core scheduling; however, most of the studies\\nfollow the conventional approach and focus on the utilization\\nand load balance of the cores. In this study, we focus on\\nincreasing data locality by bringing source information from\\nI/O into the core interrupt scheduling process. The premise is\\nto group interrupts associated for the same I/O request\\ntogether on the same core, and prove that data locality is more\\nimportant than core utilization for many applications. Based\\non this idea, a source-aware affinity interrupt-scheduling\\nscheme is introduced and a prototype system, SAIs, is\\nimplemented. Experiment results show that SAIs is feasible\\nand promising; bandwidth shows a 23.57% improvement in a\\n3-Gigabit NIC environment and in the optimal case without\\nthe NIC bottleneck, the bandwidth improvement increases to\\n53.23%.","authors":["H.
