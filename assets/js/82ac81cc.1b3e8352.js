Existing analysis tools identify bottle-\\nnecks from per-file performance data but have limitations in\\nparallelizability and rigid heuristic-based rules, necessitating\\nan automated, efficient, and multi-perspective solution. We\\ndesigned an automated tool, WisIO, that enables parallel\\nand distributed analysis of multi-terabyte-scale workflow\\nperformance data. WisIO examines performance data from\\nmultiple perspectives, uses metric-driven bottleneck classifi-\\ncation, and allows extensible mapping of bottlenecks to root\\ncauses. Experimental results demonstrate that WisIO\'s multi-\\nperspective views substantially improve bottleneck coverage,\\nshowing an average increase of up to 805\xd7 when compared\\nto analyzing performance data from a single perspective.\\nIn our performance evaluation, WisIO\'s metric-driven\\nclassification processed 340K bottlenecks per second, while\\nits reasoning engine handled around 35K bottlenecks per sec-\\nond. In an analysis of five real-world HPC workloads, WisIO\\ndemonstrated up to 11\xd7 faster analysis time and identified\\nup to 144x more bottlenecks compared to existing solutions.","authors":["I.

Additionally,\\nwe demonstrate that DFTracer has a 1.44x smaller runtime\\noverhead and 1.3-7.1x smaller trace size than state-of-the-art\\ntracing tools such as Score-P, Recorder, and Darshan. Moreover,\\nwith AI-driven workflows, Score-P, Recorder, and Darshan\\ncannot find I/O accesses from dynamically spawned processes,\\nand their load performance of 100M events is three orders of\\nmagnitude slower than DFTracer.
