In a shared\\nenvironment, tasks need to be rescheduled frequently\\nto adapt the variation of resources availability. Unlike\\nconventional task scheduling, dynamic rescheduling\\nhas to consider process migration costs in its\\nformulation. In this study, we first model the migration\\ncost and introduce an effective method to predict the\\ncost. We then introduce a dynamic scheduling\\nmechanism that considers migration cost as well as\\nother conventional influential factors for performance\\noptimization in a shared, heterogeneous environment.\\nFinally we present experimental testing to verify the\\nanalytical results. Experimental results show that the\\nproposed dynamic scheduling system is feasible and\\nimproves the system performance considerably.","authors":["C. Du","X.-H. Sun","M.
