While a multi-tiered parallel I/O system is promising for data-intensive applications in\\nhigh-performance (HPC) domains, placing data on each tier of the system to achieve high I/O performance remains a challenge. In\\nthis paper, we propose a cost-aware region-level (CARL) data placement scheme in multi-tiered parallel I/O systems. CARL divides\\na large file into several small regions, and then places regions on different types of servers based on region access costs. CARL\\nincludes a static policy S-CARL and a dynamic policy D-CARL. For applications whose I/O access patterns are completely known,\\nS-CARL calculates the region costs within the entire workload duration, and uses a static data placement scheme to selectively place\\nregions on the proper servers. To adapt to applications whose access patterns are unknown in advance, D-CARL uses a dynamic data\\nplacement scheme which migrates data among different servers within each time window. We have implemented CARL under MPI-IO\\nlibrary and OrangeFS parallel file system environment. Our evaluation with representative benchmarks and an application shows that\\nCARL is both feasible and able to improve I/O performance significantly.","authors":["S. He","Y. Wang","Z. Li","X.-H.
