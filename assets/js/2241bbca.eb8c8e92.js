These solutions consist of Par-\\nallel File Systems (PFS) for the more traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems and of Object Stores for emerging cloud\\nenvironments. More often than not, these storage solutions are tied to specific APIs and data models and thus, bind developers,\\napplications, and entire computing facilities to using certain inter-faces. Each storage system is designed and optimized for certain\\napplications but does not perform well for others. Furthermore,\\nmodern applications have become more and more complex consist-\\ning of a collection of phases with different computation and I/O\\nrequirements. In this paper, we propose a unified storage access\\nsystem, called IRIS (i.e., I/O Redirection via Integrated Storage). IRIS\\nenables unified data access and seamlessly bridges the semantic\\ngap between file systems and object stores. With IRIS, emerging\\nHigh-Performance Data Analytics software has capable and diverse\\nI/O support. IRIS can bring us closer to the convergence of HPC\\nand Cloud environments by combining the best storage subsystems\\nfrom both worlds. Experimental results show that IRIS can grant\\nmore than 7x improvement in performance than existing solutions.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","X.-H.
