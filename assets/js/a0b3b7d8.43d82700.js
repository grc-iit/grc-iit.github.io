Its several dependent projects, such as Mahout and Hive, inherent this characteristic. Meanwhile I/O optimization becomes a daunting work, since applications\' source code is not always available. I/O traces for Hadoop and its dependents are increasingly important, because it can faithfully reveal intrinsic I/O behaviors without knowing the source code. This method can not only help to diagnose system bottlenecks but also further optimize performance. To achieve this goal, we propose a transparent tracing and analysis tool suite, namely IOSIG+, which can be plugged into Hadoop system. We make several contributions: 1) we describe our approach of tracing; 2) we release the tracer, which can trace I/O operations without modifying targets\' source code; 3) this work adopts several techniques to mitigate the introduced execution overhead at runtime; 4) we create an analyzer, which helps to discover new approaches to address I/O problems according to access patterns. The experimental results and analysis confirm its effectiveness and the observed overhead can be as low as 1.97%.","authors":["B. Feng","X. Yang","K. Feng","Y. Yin","X.-H.
