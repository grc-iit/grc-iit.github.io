Newer Solid State Drives (SSD) have excellent\\nperformance on small random data accesses, but also incur a high monetary cost. In this study, we propose SLA-Cache, a Selective\\nand Layout-Aware Cache system that employs a small set of SSD-based file servers as a cache of conventional HDD-based file\\nservers. SLA-Cache uses a novel scheme to identify performance-critical data, and conducts a selective cache admission (SCA) policy\\nto fully utilize SSD-based file servers. Moreover, since data layout of the cache system can also largely influence its access\\nperformance, SLA-Cache applies a layout-aware cache placement scheme (LCP) to store data on SSD-based file servers. By storing\\ndata with an optimal layout requiring the lowest access cost among three typical layout candidates, LCP can further improve system\\nperformance. We have implemented SLA-Cache under the MPICH2 I/O library. Experimental results show that SLA-Cache can\\nsignificantly improve I/O throughput, and is a promising approach for parallel applications.","authors":["Z. Zhou","X. Yang","Z. Lan","P. Rich","W.
