Nevertheless, due to the ever-growing\\nsystem scale, the volume of such data becomes overwhelming,\\nbringing enormous burdens on both data storage and data\\nanalysis. To address this problem, we present a 2-dimensional\\nonline filtering mechanism to remove redundant and noisy data\\nvia feature selection and instance selection. The objective of this\\nwork is two-fold: (i) to significantly reduce data volume without\\nlosing important information, and (ii) to effectively promote data\\nanalysis. We evaluate this new filtering mechanism by means of\\nreal environmental data from the production supercomputers at\\nOak Ridge National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory.\\nOur preliminary results demonstrate that our method can reduce\\nmore than 85% disk space, thereby significantly reducing analysis\\ntime. Moreover, it also facilitates better failure prediction and\\ndiagnosis by more than 20%, as compared to the conventional\\npredictive approach relying on RAS (Reliability, Availability, and\\nServiceability) events alone.","authors":["L.
