As computing\\npower is increasing much faster than memory performance, we\\nsuggest that it is time to have a dedicated cache to store data access\\nhistories and to serve prefetching to mask data access latency\\neffectively. We thus propose a new cache structure, named Data\\nAccess History Cache (DAHC), and study its associated\\nprefetching mechanisms. The DAHC behaves as a cache for recent\\nreference information instead of as a traditional cache for\\ninstructions or data. Theoretically, it is capable of supporting many\\nwell known history-based prefetching algorithms, especially\\nadaptive and aggressive approaches. We have carried out\\nsimulation experiments to validate DAHC design and\\nDAHC-based data prefetching methodologies and to demonstrate\\nperformance gains. The DAHC provides a practical approach to\\nreaping data prefetching benefits and its associated prefetching\\nmechanisms are proven more effective than traditional approaches.","authors":["Y.
