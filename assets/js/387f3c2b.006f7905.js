The efficiency of a hybrid PFS\\nrelies on the file\'s data layout. However, most current layout\\nstrategies are designed and optimized for homogeneous servers.\\nUsing them directly in a hybrid PFS neither addresses the\\nheterogeneity of servers nor the varying access patterns of\\napplications, making hybrid PFSs disappointingly inefficient.\\nIn this paper, we propose HAS, a novel heterogeneity-aware\\nselective data layout scheme for hybrid PFSS. HAS alleviates the\\ninter-server load imbalance through skewing data distribution\\non heterogeneous servers based on their storage performance. To\\nlargely improve the entire system\'s I/O efficiency, HAS adaptively\\nselects the optimal data layout from three typical candidates\\naccording to the application\'s data access patterns, based on\\na newly developed selection and distribution algorithm. We\\nhave implemented HAS within OrangeFS to provide efficient\\ndata distribution for data-intensive applications. Our extensive\\nexperiments validate that HAS significantly increases the I/O\\nthroughput of hybrid PFSs, compared to existing data layout\\noptimization methods.","authors":["S. He","X.-H. Sun","A.
