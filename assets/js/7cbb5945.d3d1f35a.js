All major storage vendors have introduced their\\nrespective implementations with similar architectural designs. As\\nthe technology progresses into its second generation, the perfor-\\nmance characteristics have improved substantially. In this study,\\nwe first demonstrate the differences between two generations\\nof the OED technology. We run a variety of benchmarks and\\napplications to thoroughly evaluate the performance of this device\\nand its compatibility with the current ecosystem. Furthermore,\\nwe investigate the performance and energy footprint of the\\nOED technology when used as a storage server and as an I/O\\naccelerator. Evaluation results show that OED technology can be\\na reliable, scalable, energy and cost efficient storage solution. It\\nis a viable replacement for storage servers offering competitive\\nperformance while consuming only 10% of the power that a typ-\\nical storage node needs. Finally, this study shows that OED\'s can\\nbe used as I/O accelerators capable of executing data-intensive\\ncomputations (such as sorting, compression/decompression, etc.)\\non local data, whereby the expensive data movement is minimized\\nresulting in low power consumption.","authors":["H.
