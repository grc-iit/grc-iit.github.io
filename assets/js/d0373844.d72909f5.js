Many recent works solve this problem based on the\\nset-enumeration (SE) tree, which sequentially traverses vertices\\nto generate the enumeration tree nodes representing distinct\\nbicliques, then checks whether these bicliques are maximal or not.\\nHowever, existing MBE algorithms only expand bicliques with\\nuntraversed vertices to ensure distinction, which often necessitate\\nextensive node checks to eliminate non-maximal bicliques, result-\\ning in significant computational overhead during the enumeration\\nprocess. To address this issue, we propose an aggressive set-\\nenumeration (ASE) tree that aggressively expands all bicliques\\nto their maximal form, thus avoiding costly node checks on\\nnon-maximal bicliques. This aggressive enumeration may pro-\\nduce multiple duplicate maximal bicliques, but we efficiently\\neliminate these duplicates by leveraging the connection between\\nparent and child nodes and conducting low-cost node checking.\\nAdditionally, we introduce an aggressive merge-based pruning\\n(AMP) approach that aggressively merges vertices sharing the\\nsame local neighbors. This helps prune numerous duplicate\\nnode generations caused by subsets of merged vertices. We\\nintegrate the AMP approach into the ASE tree, and present the\\nAggressive Maximal Biclique Enumeration Algorithm (AMBEA).\\nExperimental results show that AMBEA is 1.15\xd7 to 5.32\xd7 faster\\nthan its closest competitor and exhibits better scalability and\\nparallelization capabilities on larger bipartite graphs.\\nIndex Terms-Graph computing, bipartite graph, maximal\\nbiclique enumeration.","authors":["Z.
