In this\\nstudy, we examine the architecture differences and performance characteristics of parallel file systems and key-value\\nstores. We propose using key-value stores to optimize overall Input/Output (I/O) performance, especially for workloads\\nthat parallel file systems cannot handle well, such as the cases with intense data synchronization or heavy metadata oper-\\nations. We conducted experiments with several synthetic benchmarks, an I/O benchmark, and a real application. We\\nmodeled the performance of these two systems using collected data from our experiments, and we provide a predictive\\nmethod to identify which system offers better I/O performance given a specific workload. The results show that we can\\noptimize the I/O performance in HPC systems by utilizing key-value stores.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Eslami","R. Thakur","W. D. Gropp","X.-H.
