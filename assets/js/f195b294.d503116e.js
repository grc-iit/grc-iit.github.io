Both two types of systems have their own merits\\nfor different applications. However, there are no much efforts\\nin investigating the integration of these two architectures and\\nexploiting their merits together. In this paper, we propose a\\nnovel hybrid storage architecture for large-scale data processing,\\nto leverage the benefits of both shared-nothing and shared-disk\\narchitectures. In the proposed hybrid system, we adopt a shared-\\nnothing architecture as the hardware layer and leverage a parallel\\nfile system as the storage layer to combine the scattered disks on\\nall database nodes. We present an overall design of the new\\nscheme, including data and storage organization, data access\\nmodes, and query processing methods. The proposed hybrid\\nscheme can achieve both high I/O performance as a shared-\\nnothing system, and high-speed data sharing across all server\\nnodes as a share-disk system. Preliminary experimental results\\ndemonstrate that the hybrid scheme is promising and more\\nappropriate for large-scale and data-intensive applications than\\neach of the two individual types of systems.","authors":["H.
