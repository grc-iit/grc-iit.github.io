However,\\neach of these domains has its own storage infrastructure with unique\\nI/O interfaces and storage systems, requiring feature sets that are\\noften incompatible. Users with experience in one domain lack the\\nexpertise to change their applications to match the data stacks of\\nthe other domains, necessitating expensive conversions. There is\\na need for a transparent solution for the unification of disparate\\ndata stacks for the triple convergence of HPC, Big Data, and ML\\nthat can provide the required functionality while achieving higher\\nperformance. To better support converged HPC, Big Data, and ML\\nworkflows, this paper proposes DTIO, a scalable I/O runtime that\\nunifies the disparate I/O stack for modern scientific ML workflows.\\nDTIO utilizes a unique DataTask abstraction to express the move-\\nment of data, its ordering, and its dependencies on other data as a\\ntask. DTIO achieves a unification of scientific and ML workflows\\nby utilizing intelligent mapping of interfaces, and automatically de-\\ntermines the best method to relate their unique semantics. DTIO\'s\\nonline translation with DataTask caching can improve performance\\nby 49.6% compared to offline translation methods. DTIO also offers\\nnumerous optimizations, such as asynchronous I/O and aggregation.","authors":["K. Bateman","N. Rajesh","J. Cernuda","L. Logan","B. Nicolae","F. Cappello","X.-H. Sun","A.
