Until 3G is deployed\\nubiquitously, 2-2.5G networks and endpoints will dominate. Because of their\\nwidespread deployment and adoption, these endpoints can help ease the transition\\nto an all-Internet 3G/4G network. We describe a standards-based service architec-\\nture and its implementation that allows 2-2.5G endpoints to participate as active\\nactors in realizing Internet services like presence and instant messaging without the\\nendpoints themselves being connected to the Internet. Our architecture also demon-\\nstrates service migration, wherein a successful 2G service such as short messaging\\nservice morphs transparently into its Internet equivalent, an instant message. Our\\nmethodology conserves precious radio access bandwidth by offloading such data\\nservices from the bandwidth normally allocated to voice. Our approach, as embod-\\nied in the service architecture, is to leverage the best of the Internet protocols (SIP,\\nXML) and technologies (instant messaging, presence) to provide a general frame-\\nwork for personalized service specification and execution.","authors":["V.
