This study introduces the\\nconcept of range comparison for data-parallel program-\\nming. Unlike conventional execution time comparison\\nin which performance is compared for a particular sys-\\ntem and problem size, range comparison compares the\\nperformance of programs over a range of ensemble and\\nproblem sizes via scalability and performance crossing\\npoint analysis. An algorithm is developed to predict the\\ncrossing point automatically. The correctness of the\\nalgorithm is proved and a methodology is developed to\\nintegrate range comparison into restructuring compi-\\nlations. A preliminary prototype of the methodology is\\nimplemented and tested under Vienna Fortran Compi-\\nlation System. Experimental results demonstrate that\\nrange comparison is feasible and effective.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","M. Pantano","T.
