I/O has become a vital\\nperformance bottleneck of modern HEC practice.\\nConventional HEC execution paradigms, however, are\\ncomputing-centric for computation intensive applications.\\nThey are designed to utilize memory and CPU\\nperformance and have inherent limitations in addressing\\nthe critical I/O bottleneck issues of HEC. In this study,\\nwe propose a decoupled execution paradigm (DEP) to\\naddress the challenging I/O bottleneck issues. DEP is the\\nfirst paradigm enabling users to identify and handle data-\\nintensive operations separately. It can significantly\\nreduce costly data movement and is better than the\\nexisting execution paradigms for data-intensive\\napplications. The initial experimental tests have\\nconfirmed its promising potential. Its data-centric\\narchitecture could have an impact in future HEC systems,\\nprogramming models, and algorithms design\\ndevelopment.\\nand","authors":["Y. Chen","C. Chen","X.-H. Sun","W. D.
