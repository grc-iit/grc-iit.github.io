However, these environments lack the presence of\\nefficient function-based application libraries that can utilize\\npopular communication fabrics such as TCP, Infinity Band (IB),\\nand RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE). Additionally,\\nthere is a lack of high-performance data structure interfaces. We\\npresent Hermes Container Library (HCL), a high-performance\\ndistributed data structures library that offers high-level\\nabstractions including hash-maps, sets, and queues. HCL uses a\\nRPC over RDMA technology that implements a novel procedural\\nprogramming paradigm. In this paper, we argue a RPC over\\nRDMA technology can serve as a high-performance, flexible,\\nand co-ordination free backend for implementing complex data\\nstructures. Evaluation results from testing real workloads shows\\nthat HCL programs are 2x to 12x faster compared to BCL, a\\nstate-of-the-art distributed data structure library.","authors":["H. Devarajan","A.
