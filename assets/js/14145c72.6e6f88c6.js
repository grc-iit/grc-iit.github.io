The combined impact of hierarchy\\nand concurrency, however, is application dependent and difficult to describe. In this article, we introduce\\nC2-Bound, a data-driven analytical model that serves the purpose of optimizing many-core design. C2-Bound\\nconsiders both memory capacity and data access concurrency. It utilizes the combined power of the newly\\nproposed latency model, concurrent average memory access time, and the well-known memory-bounded\\nspeedup model (Sun-Ni\'s law) to facilitate computing tasks. Compared to traditional chip designs that lack\\nthe notion of memory capacity and concurrency, the C2-Bound model finds that memory bound factors\\nsignificantly impact the optimal number of cores as well as their optimal silicon area allocations, especially\\nfor data-intensive applications with a non-parallelizable sequential portion. Therefore, our model is valuable\\nto the design of next-generation many-core architectures that target big data processing, where working sets\\nare usually larger than the conventional scientific computing. These findings are evidenced by our detailed\\nsimulations, which show, with C2-Bound, the design space of chip design can be narrowed down significantly\\nup to four orders of magnitude. C2-Bound analytic results can be either used in reconfigurable hardware\\nenvironments or, by software designers, applied to scheduling, partitioning, and allocating resources among\\ndiverse applications.","authors":["Y.-H.
