Based on numerical, dependence and partition analysis,\\nthree different levels of parallelization have been proposed and implemented. The low-\\nlevel parallelization is at the kernel level. A previously developed parallel tridiagonal\\nsolver is used for concurrent processing. The middle-level parallelization solves the\\nmultiple right-hand-sides of the tridiagonal systems concurrently. The high-level\\nparallelization is at the level of time step iterations. A PVM implementation of the\\nparallelization has been accomplished. Different communication patterns and different\\nPVM communication calls have been examined for best performance. The parallelized\\ncode has been tested on two parallel platforms, a cluster of workstations available at\\nLouisiana State University and the IBM SP2 parallel computer available at Cornell\\nSupercomputing Center. Experimental results confirm our analytical findings: the three-\\nlevel parallelization is feasible and effective. A linear speedup is measured. In addition to\\nparallelization, through profiling and performance analysis, the original sequential code is\\noptimized as well. 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Limited.
