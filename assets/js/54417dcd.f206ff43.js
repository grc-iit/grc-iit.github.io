The word scalable,\\nor scalability, has been widely and often used in the parallel\\nprocessing community. However, there is no adequate, commonly\\naccepted definition of scalability available. Scalabilities of com-\\nputer systems and programs are difficult to quantify, evaluate,\\nand compare. In this paper, scalability is formally defined for\\nalgorithm-machine combinations. A practical method is proposed\\nto provide a quantitative measurement of the scalability. The\\nrelation between the newly proposed scalability and other existing\\nparallel performance metrics is studied. A harmony between\\nspeedup and scalability has been observed. Theoretical results\\nshow that a large class of algorithm-machine combinations is\\nscalable and the scalability can be predicted through premeasured\\nmachine parameters. Two algorithms have been studied on an\\nnCUBE 2 multicomputer and on a MasPar MP-1 computer.\\nThese case studies have shown how scalabilities can be measured,\\ncomputed, and predicted. Performance instrumentation and visu-\\nalization tools also have been used and developed to understand\\nthe scalability related behavior.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","D.
