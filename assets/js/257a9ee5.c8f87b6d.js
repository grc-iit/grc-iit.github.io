However, most of the existing work is\\nlimited to redistribute independent tasks or at the\\nalgorithm design level. There is no runtime system\\navailable to support automatic redistribution of a running\\nprocess in a heterogeneous network environment. In this\\nstudy, we present the design and implementation of a\\nsystem that dynamically reschedules running processes\\nover a network of computing resources via automatic\\ndecision-making and process migration. The system is\\nimplemented on top of MPI-2 and HPCM (High\\nPerformance Computing Mobility) middleware.\\nExperimental and analytical results show that the runtime\\nsystem works well. It makes dynamic rescheduling of\\nrunning tasks possible and improves system performance\\nconsiderably. While the implementation is for MPI\\nprograms and using HPCM, the design of the system is\\ngeneral and can be extended to other distributed\\nenvironments as well.","authors":["C. Du","S.
