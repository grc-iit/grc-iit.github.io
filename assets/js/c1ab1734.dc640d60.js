These applications spend the majority of their runtime\\nin performing I/O. HPC storage solutions include fast node-local\\nand shared storage resources to elevate applications from this\\nbottleneck. Moreover, several middleware libraries (e.g., Hermes)\\nare proposed to move data between these tiers transparently.\\nData reduction is another technique that reduces the amount of\\ndata produced and, hence, improve I/O performance. These two\\ntechnologies, if used together, can benefit from each other. The\\neffectiveness of data compression can be enhanced by selecting\\ndifferent compression algorithms according to the characteristics\\nof the different tiers, and the multi-tiered hierarchy can benefit\\nfrom extra capacity. In this paper, we design and implement\\nHCompress, a hierarchical data compression library that\\ncan improve the application\'s performance by harmoniously\\nleveraging both multi-tiered storage and data compression.\\nWe have developed a novel compression selection algorithm\\nthat facilitates the optimal matching of compression libraries\\nto the tiered storage. Our evaluation shows that HCompress\\ncan improve scientific application\'s performance by 7x when\\ncompared to other state-of-the-art tiered storage solutions.","authors":["H. Devarajan","A.
