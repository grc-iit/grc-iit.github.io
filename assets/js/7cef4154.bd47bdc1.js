In\\nthis paper, we propose runtime strategies for spare node allocation and job rescheduling in response to failure prediction. These\\nstrategies, together with failure prediction and fault tolerance techniques, construct a runtime system called Fault-Aware Runtime\\nSystem (FARS). In particular, we propose a 0-1 knapsack model and demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness for reallocating running\\njobs to avoid failures. Experiments, by means of synthetic data and real traces from production systems, show that FARS has the\\npotential to significantly improve system productivity (i.e., performance and reliability).","authors":["Y.
