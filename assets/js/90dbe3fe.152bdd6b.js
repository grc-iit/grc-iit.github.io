Data-access\\ndelay, not the processor speed, becomes the leading\\nperformance bottleneck of high-end/high-performance\\ncomputing. Prefetching is an effective solution to masking the\\ngap between computing speed and data-access speed. Existing\\nworks of prefetching, however, are very conservative in\\ngeneral, due to the computing power consumption concern of\\nthe past. They suffer in effectiveness especially when\\napplications\' access pattern changes. In this study, we propose\\nan Algorithm-level Feedback-controlled Adaptive (AFA) data\\nprefetcher to address these issues. The AFA prefetcher is based\\non the Data-Access History Cache, a hardware structure that is\\nspecifically designed for data prefetching. It provides an\\nalgorithm-level adaptation and is capable of dynamically\\nadapting to appropriate prefetching algorithms at runtime. We\\nhave conducted extensive simulation testing with SimpleScalar\\nsimulator to validate the design and to illustrate the\\nperformance gain. The simulation results show that AFA\\nprefetcher is effective and achieves considerable IPC\\n(Instructions Per Cycle) improvement in average.","authors":["Y. Chen","H. Zhu","X.-H.
