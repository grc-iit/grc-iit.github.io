With the rapid growth of\\nnetwork technology for cluster computers, the idea of\\naccessing memory of an idle peer node has proven to be\\nfaster than accessing a disk. With this motivation, many\\nresearchers developed systems that offer idle memory as a\\nservice. In this paper, we present a brief survey of various\\nsystems that offer memory service in improving the disk\\naccess performance and discuss the scope of applying\\nservice oriented architecture (SOA) for HEC.","authors":["S.
