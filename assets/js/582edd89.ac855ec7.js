Nu-\\nmerous prefetching techniques have been proposed to exploit\\ndata patterns and correlations in the miss address stream.\\nIn general, the miss addresses are grouped by some common\\ncharacteristics, such as program counter or memory region\\nthey belong to, into localized streams to improve prefetch\\naccuracy and coverage. However, the existing stream lo-\\ncalization technique lacks the timing information of misses.\\nThis drawback can lead to a large fraction of untimely pre-\\nfetches, which in turn limits the effectiveness of prefetching,\\nwastes precious bandwidth and leads to high cache pollu-\\ntion potentially. This paper proposes a novel mechanism\\nnamed stream timing technique that can largely reduce un-\\ntimely prefetches and in turn increase the overall perfor-\\nmance. Based on the proposed stream timing technique, we\\nextend the conventional stride prefetcher and propose a new\\nstride prefetcher called Time-Aware Stride (TAS) prefetch-\\ner. We have carried out extensive simulation experiments to\\nverify the design of the stream timing technique and the TAS\\nprefetcher. The simulation results show that the proposed\\nstream timing technique is promising in reducing untimely\\nprefetches and the IPC improvement of TAS prefetcher out-\\nperforms the existing stride prefetcher by 11%.","authors":["H.
