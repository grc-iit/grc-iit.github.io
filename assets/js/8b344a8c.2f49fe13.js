While they have become an indispensable compo-\\nnent of modern high-end computing systems, their inadequate\\nperformance is a critical issue facing the HPC community today.\\nConventionally, a parallel file system stripes a file across multiple\\nfile servers with a fixed stripe size. The stripe size is a vital\\nperformance parameter, but the optimal value for it is often\\napplication dependent. How to determine the optimal stripe\\nsize is a difficult research problem. Based on the observation\\nthat many applications have different data-access clusters in\\none file, with each cluster having a distinguished data access\\npattern, we propose in this paper a segmented data layout scheme\\nfor parallel file systems. The basic idea behind the segmented\\napproach is to divide a file logically into segments such that an\\noptimal stripe size can be identified for each segment. A five-step\\nmethod is introduced to conduct the segmentation, to identify\\nthe appropriate stripe size for each segment, and to carry out\\nthe segmented data layout scheme automatically. Experimental\\nresults show that the proposed layout scheme is feasible and\\neffective, and it improves performance up to 163% for writing\\nand 132% for reading on the widely used IOR and IOzone\\nbenchmarks.\\nKeywords-parallel file system, adaptive data layout, file seg-\\nment, optimal stripe size, I/O performance","authors":["H.
