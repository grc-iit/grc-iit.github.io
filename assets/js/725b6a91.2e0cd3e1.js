This led to monolithic\\nand rigid storage systems that are limited by low development\\nspeed, expressiveness, and performance. Various assumptions are\\nimposed including reliance on the UNIX-file abstraction, the POSIX\\nstandard, and a narrow set of I/O policies. However, this monolithic\\ndesign philosophy makes it difficult to develop and deploy new\\nI/O approaches to satisfy the rapidly-evolving I/O requirements of\\nmodern scientific applications. To this end, we propose LabStor: a\\nmodular and extensible platform for developing high-performance,\\ncustomized I/O stacks. Single-purpose I/O modules (e.g, I/O\\nschedulers) can be developed in the comfort of userspace and released\\nas plug-ins, while end-users can compose these modules to form\\nworkload- and hardware-specific I/O stacks. Evaluations show that\\nby switching to a fully modular design, tailored I/O stacks can yield\\nperformance improvements of up to 60% in various applications.","authors":["L. Logan","J. Cernuda","J.
