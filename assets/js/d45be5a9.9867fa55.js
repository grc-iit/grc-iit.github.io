In this study, we propose a performance-aware data place-\\nment (PADP) strategy to enable efficient data layout in hybrid PFSs.\\nThe basic idea of PADP is to dispatch data on different file servers with\\nadaptive varied-size file stripes based on the server storage performance.\\nBy using an effective data access cost model and a linear programming\\noptimization method, the appropriate stripe sizes for each file server are\\ndetermined effectively. We have implemented PADP within OrangeFS,\\na widely used parallel file system in HPC domain. Experimental results\\nof representative benchmark show that PADP can significantly improve\\nthe I/O performance of hybrid PFSs.","authors":["S. He","X.-H. Sun","B. Feng","K.
