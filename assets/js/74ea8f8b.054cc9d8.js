However,\\ncurrent multi-core systems are still using conventional\\nsingle-core memory scheduling. In this study, we\\ninvestigate and evaluate traditional memory access\\nscheduling techniques, and propose a core-aware\\nmemory scheduling for multi-core environments. Since\\nmemory requests from the same source exhibit better\\nlocality, it is reasonable to schedule the requests by\\ntaking the source of the requests into consideration.\\nMotivated from this principle of locality, we propose\\ntwo core-aware policies based on traditional bank-first\\nand row-first schemes. Simulation results show that the\\ncore-aware policies can effectively improve the\\nperformance. Compared with the bank-first and\\nrow-first policies, the proposed core-aware policies\\nreduce the execution time of certain NAS Parallel\\nBenchmarks by up to 20% in running the benchmarks\\nseparately, and by 11% in running them concurrently.","authors":["Z.
