These out-of-core al-\\ngorithms suffer from severe data movement penalties, programming\\ncomplexity, and limited code reuse. To solve this, HPC sites have\\nsteadily increased DRAM capacity. However, this is not sustainable\\ndue to financial and environmental costs. A more elegant, low-cost,\\nand portable solution is to expand memory to distributed multi-\\ntiered storage. In this work, we propose MegaMmap: a software\\ndistributed shared memory (DSM) that enlarges effective memory\\ncapacity through intelligent tiered DRAM and storage management.\\nMegaMmap provides workload-aware data organization, eviction,\\nand prefetching policies to reduce DRAM consumption while ensur-\\ning speedy access to critical data. A variety of memory coherence\\noptimizations are provided through an intuitive hinting system.\\nEvaluations show that various workloads can be executed with a\\nfraction of the DRAM while offering competitive performance.","authors":["L.
