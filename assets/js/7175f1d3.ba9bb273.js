PTH has two levels of parallelism. The first level is based on algorithms developed from the Sherman-Morrison\\nmodification formula, and the second level can choose different parallel tridiagonal solvers for different applications. By choosing\\ndifferent outer and inner solvers and by controlling its two-level partition, PTH can deliver better performance for different applications\\non different machine ensembles and problem sizes. In an extreme case, the two levels of parallelism can be merged into one, and PTH\\ncan be the best algorithm otherwise available. Theoretical analyses and numerical experiments indicate that PTH is significantly better\\nthan existing methods on massively parallel computers. For instance, using PTH in a fast Poisson solver results in a 2-folds speedup\\ncompared to a conventional parallel Poisson solver on a 512 nodes IBM machine. When only the tridiagonal solver is considered, PTH\\nis over 10 times faster than the currently used implementation.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","W.
