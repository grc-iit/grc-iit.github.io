Existing tools use either offline profiling or\\nonline analysis to get insights into the applications\' I/O patterns.\\nHowever, there is lack of a clear formula to characterize applica-\\ntions\' I/O. Moreover, these tools are application specific and do\\nnot account for multi-tenant systems. This paper presents Vidya,\\nan I/O profiling framework which can predict application\'s I/O\\nintensity using a new formula called Code-Block I/O Character-\\nization (CIOC). Using CIOC, developers and system architects\\ncan tune an application\'s I/O behavior and better match the\\nunderlying storage system to maximize performance. Evaluation\\nresults show that Vidya can predict an application\'s I/O intensity\\nwith a variance of 0.05%. Vidya can profile applications with a\\nhigh accuracy of 98% while reducing profiling time by 9x. We\\nfurther show how Vidya can optimize an application\'s I/O time\\nby 3.7x.","authors":["H.
