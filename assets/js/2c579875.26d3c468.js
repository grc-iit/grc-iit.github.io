Recent performance improvement of CPU\\nand computer network has made memory usage a\\nsignificant factor of overall performance. In this study, we\\nconsider memory availability as a performance factor and\\nintroduce memory conscious task partition and\\nscheduling. Three task partition policies are discussed.\\nThey are CPU-based, memory-based, and CPU-memory\\ncombined partition. We first investigate the three task\\npartition policies on dedicated resources and verify the\\neffectiveness of the CPU-memory combined partition\\nalgorithm in finding an optimal solution. We then extend\\nthe task partition policies in non-dedicated environments\\nwith the consideration of resource sharing. Analytical and\\nexperimental results show that the CPU-memory\\ncombined scheduling approach outperforms either the\\nCPU-based or memory-based scheduling approach\\nconsiderably for memory-intensive applications in Grid\\nenvironments.","authors":["M.
