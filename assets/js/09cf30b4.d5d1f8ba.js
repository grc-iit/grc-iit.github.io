With the emergence of Grid and\\nubiquitous computing, new challenges appear in task scheduling based on properties such as security,\\nquality of service, and lack of central control within distributed administrative domains. A Grid task\\nscheduling framework must be able to deal with these issues. One of the goals of Grid task scheduling\\nis to achieve high system throughput while matching application needs with the available computing\\nresources. This matching of resources in a non-deterministically shared heterogeneous environment\\nleads to concerns over Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper we introduce a novel QoS guided task\\nscheduling algorithm for Grid computing. Our novel algorithm is based on a general adaptive\\nscheduling heuristics that includes QoS guidance. We evaluate our algorithm within a simulated Grid\\nenvironment. These experimental results show that the new QoS guided Min-Min heuristic can lead to\\nsignificant performance gain for a variety of applications. We compare our approach to others based\\non the quality of the prediction formulated by inaccurate information.","authors":["X. He","X.-H. Sun","G.
