Several commercial and research parallel file systems\\nhave been developed in recent years to ease the performance bot-\\ntleneck. These advanced file systems perform well on some appli-\\ncations but may not perform well on others. They have not reached\\ntheir full potential in mitigating the I/O-wall problem. Data access\\nis application dependent. Based on the application-specific opti-\\nmization principle, in this study we propose a cost-intelligent data\\naccess strategy to improve the performance of parallel file systems.\\nWe first present a novel model to estimate data access cost of differ-\\nent data layout policies. Next, we extend the cost model to calculate\\nthe overall I/O cost of any given application and choose an appro-\\npriate layout policy for the application. A complex application may\\nconsist of different data access patterns. Averaging the data access\\npatterns may not be the best solution for those complex applica-\\ntions that do not have a dominant pattern. We then further propose\\na hybrid data replication strategy for those applications, so that a\\nfile can have replications with different layout policies for the best\\nperformance. Theoretical analysis and experimental testing have\\nbeen conducted to verify the newly proposed cost-intelligent lay-\\nout approach. Analytical and experimental results show that the\\nproposed cost model is effective and the application-specific data\\nlayout approach achieved up to 74% performance improvement for\\ndata-intensive applications.","authors":["H.
