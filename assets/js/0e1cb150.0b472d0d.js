Object stores follow a simpler API with\\nget() and put() operations to interact with the data. A wide variety\\nof data analysis software has been developed around objects\\nusing their APIs. In fact, the evolution of Big Data analytics is a\\nmajor driver for highly optimized data-centric quality software.\\nHowever, organizations maintain file-based storage clusters and a\\nhigh volume of existing data are stored in files. This is specifically\\ntrue for the scientific communities. In this paper, we present the\\nkey characteristics of object-based and file-based storage APIs,\\nwe explore several object-to-file mappings aiming to bridge the\\nsemantic gap between these data models. The evaluation of our\\nmapping algorithms exposes various strengths and weaknesses\\nof each strategy and frames the extended potential of a unified\\ndata access system. Results show that our solution can offer more\\nthan 3x higher performance for specific workloads while keeping\\nminimal overhead of our library.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","X.-H.
