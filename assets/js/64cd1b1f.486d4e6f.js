However, the variability of hosts\\nresources and availability could substantially degrade the\\nperformance of MapReduce applications. The replication-\\nbased fault tolerance mechanism helps to alleviate some\\nproblems at the cost of inefficient storage space utilization.\\nIntelligent solutions that guarantee the performance of\\nMapReduce applications with low data replication degree are\\nneeded to promote the idea of running MapReduce\\napplications in non-dedicated environment at lower costs. In\\nthis research, we propose an Availability-aware DAta\\nPlacemenT (ADAPT) strategy to improve the application\\nperformance without extra storage cost. The basic idea of\\nADAPT is to dispatch data based on the availability of each\\nnode, reduce network traffic, improve data locality, and\\noptimize the application performance. We implement the\\nprototype of ADAPT within the Hadoop framework, an open-\\nsource implementation of MapReduce. The performance of\\nADAPT is evaluated in\\nemulated non-dedicated\\ndistributed environment. The experimental results show that\\nADAPT can improve the performance by more than 30%.\\nADAPT achieves high reliability without the need for\\nadditional data replication. ADAPT has also been evaluated\\nfor large-scale computing environment through simulations,\\nwith promising results.\\nan\\nKeywords-MapReduce, Reliability, Performance","authors":["H. Jin","X.
