Addressing the big data challenge requires\\nan approach that utilizes both high performance computing and\\ndata-intensive computing power. Thus, HPC applications may\\nneed to interact with distributed file systems, such as HDFS. The\\nN-1 (N-to-1) parallel file write is a critical technical challenge,\\nbecause it is very common for HPC applications but HDFS does\\nnot allow it. This study introduces a system solution, named\\nSCALER, which allows MPI based applications to directly access\\nHDFS without extra data movement. SCALER supports N-1\\nfile write at both the inter-block level and intra-block level.\\nExperimental results confirm that SCALER achieves the design\\ngoal efficiently.","authors":["X. Yang","Y.
