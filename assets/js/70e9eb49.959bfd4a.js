Data Locality has been the focus of reducing data access\\ndelay. Data access concurrency, however, has become prevalent in modern memory systems in recent years. How to extend existing\\nlocality-based performance optimization to consider data concurrency becomes a timely issue facing the researchers and practitioners\\nin the field of computing, especially in the field of big data computing. In this study, we introduce the concept and definition of\\nConcurrency-aware data access Locality (CaL), which, as its name states, extends the concept of locality by considering concurrency.\\nCompared to the conventional concept of locality, CaL accurately reflects the combined impact of data access locality and concurrency\\nin modern memory systems and is very effective for data intensive applications. The value of CaL can be quantitatively measured\\ndirectly by performance counters in mainstream commercial processors and is practically feasible. Two theoretical results are\\npresented to reveal the relationships between CaL and existing memory system performance metrics of memory accesses per cycle\\n(APC), average memory access time (AMAT), and memory bandwidth (B). In this way, we provide a methodology to use existing\\nlocality-based optimization methods directly or in combination with data concurrency optimizations, to improve the value of CaL and to\\nimprove the performance of a memory system. To demonstrate the practical value of CaL, we conduct four case studies to illustrate the\\npower of concurrency-aware locality optimization. Compared with the conventional locality based optimization, the CaL-aware design\\nhas achieved significant performance improvement. It achieved a 3.12-fold speedup on K-means, which is a widely-used data analytic\\nkernel from the big data benchmarks.","authors":["Y. Liu","X.-H.
