The\\nconventional HPC systems are computing-centric and designed\\nfor computation-intensive applications. Scientific big data ap-\\nplications have growlingly different characteristics compared to\\nbig compute applications. These scientific applications, however,\\nwill still largely rely on HPC systems to be solved. In this\\nresearch, we try to answer this question with a rethinking of HPC\\nsystem architecture. We study and analyze the potential of a new\\ndecoupled HPC system architecture for data-intensive scientific\\napplications. The fundamental idea is to decouple conventional\\ncompute nodes and dynamically provision as data processing\\nnodes that focus on data processing capability. We present studies\\nand analyses for such decoupled HPC system architecture.\\nThe current results have shown its promising potential. Its\\ndata-centric architecture can have an impact in designing and\\ndeveloping future HPC systems for growingly important data-\\nintensive scientific discovery and innovation.","authors":["Y.
