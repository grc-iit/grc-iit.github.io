Failure is an unwanted but inevitable fact that\\nall large-scale parallel computing systems have to face with.\\nMapReduce introduces a novel data replication and task re-\\nexecution strategy for fault tolerance. This study intends to lead\\na better understanding of such fault tolerance mechanisms. In\\nparticular, we build a stochastic performance model to quantify\\nthe impact of failures on MapReduce applications and to inves-\\ntigate its effectiveness under different computing environments.\\nSimulations also have been carried out to verify the accuracy\\nof the proposed model. Our results show that data replication\\nis an effective approach even when failure rate is high, and\\nthe task migration mechanism of MapReduce works well in\\nbalancing the reliability difference among individual nodes. This\\nwork provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing large-scale\\nMapReduce applications, especially when fault tolerance is the\\nconcern.","authors":["H. Jin","K. Qiao","X.-H. Sun","Y.
