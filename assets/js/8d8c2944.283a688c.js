Although\\nthe increasing use of descriptive data formats (e.g., HDF5,\\nnetCDF) helps organize these datasets, it also introduces obscure\\nbottlenecks due to the need to translate high-level operations\\ninto file addresses and then into low-level I/O operations. To\\naddress this challenge, we introduce DaYu, a method and toolset\\nfor analyzing (a) semantic relationships between logical datasets\\nand file addresses, (b) how dataset operations translate into\\nI/O, and (c) the combination across entire workflows. DaYu\'s\\nanalysis and visualization enable the identification of critical\\nbottlenecks and the reasoning about remediation. We describe\\nour methodology and propose optimization guidelines. Evaluation\\non scientific workflows demonstrates up to a 3.7x performance\\nimprovement in I/O time for obscure bottlenecks. The time and\\nstorage overhead for DaYu\'s time-ordered data are typically\\nunder 0.2% of runtime and 0.25% of data volume, respectively.","authors":["M. Tang","J. Cernuda","J. Ye","L. Guo","N.

To\\nguide these decisions, this paper introduces data flow lifecycle anal-\\nysis. Workflows are commonly represented using directed acyclic\\ngraphs (DAGs). Data flow lifecycles (DFL) enrich task DAGs with\\ndata objects and properties that describe data flow and how tasks\\ninteract with that flow. Lifecycles enable analysis from several\\nimportant perspectives: task, data, and data flow. We describe rep-\\nresentation, measurement, analysis, visualization, and opportunity\\nidentification for DFLs. Our measurement is both distributed and\\nscalable, using space that is constant per data file. We use lifecycles\\nand opportunity analysis to reason about improved task placement\\nand reduced data movement for five scientific workflows with dif-\\nferent characteristics. Case studies show improvements of 15x, 1.9\xd7,\\nand 10-30x. Our work is implemented in the DataLife tool.","authors":["H. Lee","L. Guo","M. Tang","J. Firoz","N. Tallent","A. Kougkas","X.-H.
