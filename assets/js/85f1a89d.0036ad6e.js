Distributed Ordered\\nTable (DOT) is one kind of NoSQL database that has attracted\\nlots of attention. It horizontally partitions table into regions\\nand distributes regions to region servers according to the\\nkeys. Multi-Dimensional Range Query (MDRQ) is a common\\noperation over DOTs. Many indexing techniques have been\\nproposed to improve the performance of MDRQ, but they\\ncannot guarantee high performance on both insert and flexible\\nMDRQ at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel\\nindexing technique named LCIndex, short for Local and\\nClustering Index, to solve this issue. Experimental results\\nconfirm that LCIndex can achieve high performance on both\\ninsert operations and flexible MDRQ.","authors":["C. Feng","X. Yang","F. Liang","X.-H. Sun","Z.
