Much effort has been devoted to scalability\\nresearch and several metrics are proposed. However,\\nthe lacking of an effective scalability analysis toolkit is\\nstill a major barrier for researchers to measure and\\nanalyze scalabilities. Isospeed scalability is a known\\nmetric and has been extended for general computing\\nsystems recently. This paper proposes an effective\\nScalability Testing and Analysis System, called STAS,\\nand presents its implementation with isospeed-e\\nscalability metric. STAS provides the facility to conduct\\nautomated isospeed-e scalability measure and analysis.\\nIt reduces the burden for users to evaluate the\\nperformance of algorithms and systems. Experiments\\nhave been conducted to verify the design and\\nimplementation.","authors":["Y. Chen","X.-H.
