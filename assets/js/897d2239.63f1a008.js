In this study, we identify some key\\nchallenges to efficiently handling interleaved data accesses, and we\\npropose a system-wide solution to optimize global performance.\\nWe implemented and tested several I/O scheduling policies,\\nincluding prioritizing specific applications by leveraging burst\\nbuffers to defer the conflicting accesses from another application\\nand/or directing the requests to different storage servers inside\\nthe parallel file system infrastructure. The results show that we\\nmitigate the negative effects of interference and optimize the\\nperformance up to 2x depending on the selected I/O policy.","authors":["A. Kougkas","M. Dorier","R.
