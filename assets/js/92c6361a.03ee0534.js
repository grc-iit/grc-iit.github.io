However,\\ntypical monitoring services store their telemetry data in a database\\nin order to allow applications to query them, resulting in significant\\nlatency penalties. This work presents Apollo: a low-latency mon-\\nitoring service that aims to provide applications and middleware\\nlibraries with direct access to relational telemetry data. Monitoring\\nthe system can create interference and overhead, slowing down raw\\nperformance of the resources for the job. However, having a current\\nview of the system can aid middleware services in making more\\noptimal decisions which can ultimately improve the overall perfor-\\nmance. Apollo has been designed from the ground up to provide\\nlow latency, using Publish\u2013Subscribe (Pub-Sub) semantics, and low\\noverhead, using adaptive intervals in order to change the length of\\ntime between polling the resource for telemetry data and machine\\nlearning in order to predict changes to the telemetry data between\\nactual resource polling. This work also provides some high level\\nabstractions called I/O curators, which can further aid middleware\\nlibraries and applications to make optimal decisions. Evaluations\\nshowcase that Apollo can achieve sub-millisecond latency for acquir-\\ning complex insights with a memory overhead of ~57MB and CPU\\noverhead being only 7% more than existing state-of-the-art systems.","authors":["N.
