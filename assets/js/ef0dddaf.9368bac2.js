In this study, a Layered Performance\\nMatching (LPM) model and its associated algorithm are proposed\\nto match the request and reply speed for each layer of a memory\\nhierarchy to improve memory performance. The rationale of\\nLPM is that the performance of each layer of a memory hierarchy\\nshould and can be optimized to closely match the request of\\nthe layer directly above it. The LPM model simultaneously\\nconsiders both data access concurrency and locality. It reveals\\nthe fact that increasing the effective overlapping between hits\\nand misses of the higher layer will alleviate the performance\\nimpact of the lower layer. The terms pure miss and pure miss\\npenalty are introduced to measure the effectiveness of such\\nhit-miss overlapping. By distinguishing between (general) miss\\nand pure miss, we have made LPM optimization practical and\\nfeasible. Our evaluation shows the data stall time can be reduced\\nsignificantly with an optimized hardware configuration. We also\\nhave achieved noticeable performance improvement by simply\\nadopting smart LPM scheduling without changing the underlying\\nhardware configurations. Analysis and experimental results show\\nLPM is feasible and effective. It provides a novel and efficient\\nway to cope with the ever-widening memory wall problem, and\\nto optimize the vital memory system design.","authors":["Y.-H. Liu","X.-H.
