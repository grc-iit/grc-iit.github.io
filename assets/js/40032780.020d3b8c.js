PTH is designed based on Parallel\\nDiagonal Dominant (PDD) algorithm. Like PDD, PTH is\\nhighly scalable. It provides accurate solutions when PDD\\nmay not be applicable and maintains a near PDD\\nperformance when the underlying machine ensemble size\\nis large. By controlling its two-level partition, PTH can\\ndeliver optimal performance for different machine\\nensemble and problem sizes. Theoretical analyses and\\nnumerical experiments indicate that PTH is significantly\\nbetter than existing methods for many scientific and\\nengineering applications.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","W.
