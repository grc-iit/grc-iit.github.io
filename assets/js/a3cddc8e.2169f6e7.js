Regardless of the\\nconsiderable research efforts, little work has been\\ndone on improving its restart latency. The time spent\\non retrieving and loading the checkpoint image during\\na recovery is non-trivial, especially in networked\\nenvironments. With the ever-increasing application\\nmemory footprint and system failure rate, it is\\nbecoming more of an issue. In this paper, we present a\\nFast Restart Mechanism called FREM. It allows fast\\nrestart of a failed process without requiring the\\navailability of the entire checkpoint image. By\\ndynamically tracking the process data accesses after\\neach checkpoint, FREM masks restart latency by\\noverlapping the computation of the resumed process\\nwith the retrieval of its checkpoint image. We have\\nimplemented FREM with the BLCR checkpointing tool\\nin Linux systems. Our experiments with the SPEC\\nbenchmarks indicate that it can effectively reduce\\nrestart latency by 61.96% on average in networked\\nenvironments.","authors":["Y. Li","Z.
