Exploiting this\\ncomplex infrastructure requires efficient middleware to\\nsupport the execution of distributed applications, which\\npresents the challenge on how to schedule tasks in shared\\nheterogeneous systems. Most existing scheduling systems\\nare based on pre-determined estimation of task completion\\ntime and resources availability. They may not provide\\nappropriate scheduling if the underlying computing\\nresources present an abnormal usage pattern during an\\napplication execution.\\nFor solving long-running\\napplications in a large-scale Grid environment, abnormal\\nusage of some resource may not be uncommon. We have\\nproposed the development of the Grid Harvest Service\\n(GHS) performance evaluation and task scheduling system\\nin our previous work. In this study, we present a novel\\ndynamic self-adaptive scheduling algorithm and its\\nimplementation under GHS. Scheduling and re-scheduling\\nalgorithms and mechanisms are carefully investigated.\\nExperimental results show that, equipped with these new\\nscheduling mechanisms, GHS outperforms existing systems\\nconsiderably in scheduling large applications in a non-\\ndedicated heterogeneous environment.","authors":["M.
