In this paper, we investigate how to support a wide\\nvariety of conflicting I/O workloads under a single storage system.\\nWe introduce the idea of a Label, a new data representation, and,\\nwe present LABIOS: a new, distributed, Label- based I/O system.\\nLABIOS boosts I/O performance by up to 17x via asynchronous I/O,\\nsupports heterogeneous storage resources, offers storage elastic-\\nity, and promotes in-situ analytics via data provisioning. LABIOS\\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of storage bridging to support the\\nconvergence of HPC and BigData workloads on a single platform.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","J.
