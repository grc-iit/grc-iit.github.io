In recent years, hybrid PFSs that consist of HDD-\\nSSD servers, have attracted much attention in HPC community.\\nHowever, existing data layout schemes do not well consider\\nthe characteristics of heterogeneous servers and heterogeneous\\naccess patterns, thus may experience considerable inefficiencies.\\nIn this study, we propose MHA, a migratory heterogeneity-aware\\ndata layout scheme to improve the data distribution of hybrid\\nPFS. More specifically, to accommodate heterogeneous access\\npatterns, MHA first migrates file data into several regions, each\\nwith similar access patterns. Then, by leveraging a data access\\ncost model, MHA determines the appropriate stripe sizes on\\nheterogeneous servers to get the best performance on each region.\\nWe have implemented MHA under MPI-IO library on top of\\nOrangeFS file system. Experimental results show that MHA can\\nsignificantly improve the hybrid PFS I/O system performance\\ncompared to existing data layout schemes.","authors":["S. He","X.-H. Sun","Y. Wang","C.
