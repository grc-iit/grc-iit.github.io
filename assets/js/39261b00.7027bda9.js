Adaptively subsetting large amounts of\\ndata to extract the interesting events such as the centers of\\nhurricane or thunderstorm, statistically analyzing and visualizing\\nthe subset data, is an effective way to analyze ever-growing data.\\nThis is particularly crucial for analyzing Earth Science data,\\nsuch as extreme weather. The Hadoop ecosystem (i.e., HDFS,\\nMapReduce, Hive) provides a cost-efficient big data management\\nenvironment and is being explored for analyzing big Earth\\nScience data.\\nOur study investigates the potential of a MapReduce-like\\nparadigm to perform statistical calculations, and utilizes the\\ncalculated results to subset as well as visualize data in a scalable\\nand efficient way. RHadoop and SparkR are deployed to enable\\nR to access and process data in parallel with Hadoop and\\nSpark, respectively. The regular R libraries and tools are utilized\\nto create and manipulate images. Statistical calculations, such\\nas maximum and average variable values, are carried with R\\nor SQL. We have developed a strategy to conduct query and\\nvisualization within one phase, and thus significantly improve the\\noverall performance in a scalable way. The technical challenges\\nand limitations of both Hadoop and Spark platforms for R are\\nalso discussed.","authors":["X. Yang","S. Liu","K. Feng","S. Zhou","X.-H.
