In this paper, we present a general approach\\nto creating hybrid models of this type. We show that for the scientific\\napplications of interest, the scaled performance is somewhat predictable\\ndue to the regular characteristics of the measured codes. Furthermore,\\nthe resulting method encourages streamlined performance evaluation by\\ndetermining which analysis steps may provide further insight to code\\nperformance.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","K.
