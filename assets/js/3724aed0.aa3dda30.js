It is benefical if the data layout on DRAM, which is\\ndecided by address mapping, can serve data accesses with either\\ngreat locality or bank-level parallelism. However for some cases,\\nthere exists a huge mismatch between access patterns and data\\nlayout of applications, which introduces the difficulty in obtaining\\nlocality or parallelism and current general address mapping\\ncannot resolve it well.\\nIn an effort to overcome this challenge, we present an self-\\nadaptive address mapping mechanism in memory controller to\\nbe aware of different access patterns on DRAM without any\\nprior knowledge of applications. Moreover, there is nearly no\\nmodification on softwares, including applications, libraries and\\nOS. We take several versions of matrix multiplication as an early\\nverification, since their patterns are regular and simple to control.\\nImpressively, the results reveal that memory performance of naive\\nand tiling versions is improved up to 3.4x and 2.7x at most,\\n2.1x and 1.7x on average respectively. The whole execution time\\nis reduced by up to 24% and 8% averagely. Even for highly-\\noptimized implementations, execution time is decreased by 7%\\nand memory performance speeds up to 1.6x on average.","authors":["C. Li","M. Zhang","Z. Xu","X.-H.
