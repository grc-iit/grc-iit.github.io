On May 7, Professor Xian-He Sun, a distinguished professor at the Illinois Institute\\nof Technology (IIT) and director of the Gnosis Research Center, delivered a keynote titled \\"AI & Data: Challenges and\\nOpportunities in Computer System Research.\\"\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img src={Image1} width=\\"300\\" />\\n</center>\\n\\nIn his keynote, Professor Sun addressed the complex challenges and emerging opportunities in computer system design\\nbrought about by the era of AI and big data. He highlighted the scalability issues caused by data access performance\\nbottlenecks in current computer systems. This storage wall has led to a new performance analysis framework that prioritizes\\ndata throughput over floating-point computation.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img src={Image2} width=\\"400\\" />\\n</center>\\n\\nProfessor Sun emphasized that data systems are inherently more complex than computing systems. It was discussed the necessity\\nof comprehensive redesigns and optimizations across operating systems, compilers, and hardware which must be designed to fully\\nexploit emerging hardware technologies by making use of optimization methods such as data tiering, compression, indexing, and\\nprefetching. Only through new architectures and performance models can future HPC systems mitigate the \\"storage wall\\" performance\\nbottleneck in AI and big data computing.\\n\\nHe highlighted how these new challenges present fundamental research tasks, and opportunities for computer scientists and engineers.\\nTo emphasizes these opportunities, Professor Sun highlighted some of the research performed here at the Gnosis Research Center:\\n\\n- [Concurrent Average Memory Access Time (C-AMAT) Model](http://cs.iit.edu/~scs/psfiles/SUN-ConcurrentAMAT__IEEE_May2014.pdf):\\n  This model accurately reflects memory performance in modern high-performance\\n  computing systems, emphasizing the importance of addressing unhidden miss penalties in high concurrency storage operations.\\n- [Layered Performance Matching (LPM)](http://cs.iit.edu/~scs/assets/files/liu2019lpm.pdf): A method for optimizing storage systems\\n  to achieve near-cache performance with large capacity. This method is implemented in the Hermes data input/output hierarchical\\n  management system, which significantly enhances performance in scientific computing, big data applications, cloud computing, and deep learning.\\n- [Hermes](/research/projects/hermes): Supported by the National Science Foundation, Hermes leverages the C-AMAT model and LPM method,\\n  utilizing new storage technologies like NVRAM to enhance performance by 2-3 times. Hermes\'s success has led to collaboration projects such as\\n  [ChronoLog](/research/projects/chronolog), [Coeus](/research/projects/coeus), and [DTIO](/research/projects/dtio).\\n\\nProfessor Sun\'s team continues to optimize storage systems to enhance performance across various computing fields, reflecting the\\nsignificant shift from computation-centric to data-centric computing. This ongoing work is essential in addressing the evolving needs\\nof AI and big data applications, presenting substantial and ongoing challenges for computer scientists and engineers."},{"id":"/2023/10/25/introducing-grc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/10/25/introducing-grc","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-25-introducing-grc/index.mdx","title":"Introducing the Gnosis Research Center","description":"Introducing the Gnosis Research Center","date":"2023-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 25, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.025,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Tang","title":"PhD Candidate & Social Media Manager","url":"https://github.com/candiceT233","imageURL":"https://grc.iit.edu/assets/images/tang-67580bc9ffbc745a2d79fffe4dcf2616.jpg","key":"candice"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing the Gnosis Research Center","authors":"candice"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"CCGRID\'24 Keynote Review","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/07/sun-ccgrid-keynote"}},"content":"Introducing the Gnosis Research Center"}]}')}}]);
