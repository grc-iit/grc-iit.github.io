Users typically pre-\\nfer to checkpoint into a shared file yet parallel file systems often\\nperform poorly for shared file writing. A powerful technique to\\naddress this problem is to transparently transform shared file\\nwriting into many exclusively written as is done in ADIOS and\\nPLFS. Unfortunately, the metadata to reconstruct the fragments\\ninto the original file grows with the number of writers. As such,\\nthe current approach cannot scale to exaflop supercomputers due\\nto the large overhead of creating and reassembling the metadata.\\nIn this paper, we develop and evaluate algorithms by which\\npatterns in the PLFS metadata can be discovered and then\\nused to replace the current metadata. Our evaluation shows that\\nthese patterns reduce the size of the metadata by several orders\\nof magnitude, increase the performance of writes by up to 40\\npercent, and the performance of reads by up to 480 percent. This\\ncontribution therefore can allow current checkpointing models to\\nsurvive the transition from peta- to exascale.","authors":["J. He","J. Bent","A. Torres","G. Grider","G. Gibson","C.
