However, much research has shown that OSes\\nimpose serious overheads on every I/O operation, especially\\non high-performance storage and networking hardware (e.g.,\\nPMEM and 200GBe). Thus, distributed storage stacks are\\nbeing re-designed to take advantage of this modern hard-\\nware by utilizing new hardware interfaces which bypass the\\nkernel entirely. However, the impact of these optimizations\\nhave not been well-studied for real HPC workloads on real\\nhardware. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evalua-\\ntion of DAOS: a state-of-the-art distributed storage system\\nwhich re-architects the storage stack from scratch for mod-\\nern hardware. We compare DAOS against traditional storage\\nstacks and demonstrate that by utilizing optimal interfaces\\nto hardware, performance improvements of up to 6x can be\\nobserved in real scientific applications.","authors":["L.
