Our recent work proposed a new architecture to address the\\nI/O bottleneck of the conventional wisdom, and the system prototype (FusionFS) demonstrated its effectiveness on up to 16 K\\nnodes-the scale on par with today\'s largest supercomputers. The main objective of this paper is to investigate FusionFS\'s scalability\\ntowards exascale. Exascale computers are predicted to emerge by 2018, comprising millions of cores and billions of threads. We built\\nan event-driven simulator (FusionSim) according to the FusionFS architecture, and validated it with FusionFS\'s traces. FusionSim\\nintroduced less than 4 percent error between its simulation results and FusionFS traces. With FusionSim we simulated workloads on up\\nto two million nodes and find out almost linear scalability of I/O performance; results justified FusionFS\'s viability for exascale systems.\\nIn addition to the simulation work, this paper extends the FusionFS system prototype in the following perspectives: (1) the fault\\ntolerance of file metadata is supported, (2) the limitations of the current system design is discussed, and (3) a more thorough\\nperformance evaluation is conducted, such as N-to-1 metadata write, system efficiency, and more platforms such as Amazon Cloud.","authors":["D.
