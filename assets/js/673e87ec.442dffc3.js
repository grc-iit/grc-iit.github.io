Although they provide exceptional computing\\npower, GPGPU impose significant pressure on the off-chip\\nmemory system. Evaluating, understanding, and improving\\nGPGPU data access delay has become an important research topic\\nin high-performance computing. In this study, we utilize the\\nnewly proposed GPGPU/C-AMAT (Concurrent Average Memory\\nAccess Time) model to quantitatively evaluate GPGPU memory\\nperformance. Specifically, we extend the current C-AMAT model\\nto include a GPGPU-specific modeling component and then\\nprovide its evaluation results.","authors":["N. Zhang","C. Jiang","X.-H. Sun","S.
