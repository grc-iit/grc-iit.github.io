With hardware and/or\\nsoftware support, data prefetching brings data closer\\nto a processor before it is actually needed. Many\\nprefetching techniques have been proposed in the last\\nfew years to reduce data access latency by taking\\nadvantage of multi-core architectures. In this paper,\\nwe propose a taxonomy that classifies various design\\nconcerns in developing a prefetching strategy.
