The efficiency of a hybrid PFS relies on the data layout schemes. However, most current layout strategies are\\ndesigned for homogeneous servers, which neither address the heterogeneity of servers nor the varying access patterns of applications.\\nIn this paper, we propose HAS, a novel heterogeneity-aware selective data layout scheme for hybrid PFSs. HAS alleviates inter-server\\nload imbalance through skewing data distribution on heterogeneous servers based on their storage performance. Furthermore, to obtain\\nthe optimal performance for a specific access pattern, HAS selects one static data layout policy with lowest access cost from three typical\\nlayout candidates as the final file data layout method. To adapt to the mixed access patterns within an application, HAS uses a dynamic\\ndata layout scheme, which stores file with multiple copies, each using a different data layout policy, and then selects the copy with the\\nlowest access cost to serve file requests. We have implemented HAS within MPICH2 and OrangeFS. Experimental results show that\\nHAS can significantly increase the I/O throughput of hybrid PFSs, compared to existing data layout optimization methods.","authors":["S. He","Y. Wang","X.-H.
