Many methods have\\nbeen proposed in recent years to mask faults. These methods,\\nhowever, impose various performance and production costs. A\\nbetter understanding of faults\' influence on application\\nperformance is necessary to use existing fault tolerant methods\\nwisely. In this study, we first introduce some practical and\\neffective performance models to predict the application\\ncompletion time under system failures. These models separate the\\ninfluence of failure rate, failure repair, checkpointing period,\\ncheckpointing cost, and parallel task allocation on parallel and\\nsequential execution times. To benefit the end users of a given\\ncomputing platform, we then develop effective fault-aware task\\nscheduling algorithms to optimize application performance under\\nsystem failures. Finally, extensive simulations and experiments\\nare conducted to evaluate our prediction models and scheduling\\nstrategies with actual failure trace.","authors":["M. Wu","X.-H. Sun","H.
