They\\nare fixed-size speedup, fixed-time speedup, and memory-bounded\\nspeedup. The latter two consider the relationship between speedup\\nand problem scalability. Two sets of speedup formulations are\\nderived for these three models. One set considers uneven workload\\nallocation and communication overhead and gives more accurate\\nestimation. Another set considers a simplified case and provides a\\nclear picture on the impact of the sequential portion of an applica-\\ntion on the possible performance gain from parallel processing.\\nThe simplified fixed-size speedup is Amdahl\'s law. The simplified\\nfixed-time speedup is Gustafson\'s scaled speedup. The simplified\\nmemory-bounded speedup contains both Amdahl\'s law and Gus-\\ntafson\'s scaled speedup as special cases. This study leads to a\\nbetter understanding of parallel processing.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","L.
