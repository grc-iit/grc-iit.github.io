Data replication is a\\npopular approach to meet several of these requirements, such as\\nlow latency, read availability, durability, etc. This approach can\\nbe enhanced using new modern heterogeneous hardware and soft-\\nware techniques such as data compression. However, both these\\nenhancements work in isolation to the detriment of both. In this\\nwork, we present HReplica: a dynamic data replication engine\\nwhich harmoniously leverages data compression and hierarchical\\nstorage to increase the effectiveness of data replication. We have\\ndeveloped a novel dynamic selection algorithm that facilitates the\\noptimal matching of replication schemes, compression libraries,\\nand tiered storage. Our evaluation shows that HReplica can\\nimprove scientific and cloud application performance by 5.2x\\nwhen compared to other state-of-the-art replication schemes.\\nIndex Terms-data replication, dynamic, selection algorithm,\\nmulti-tiered, data compression, intelligent selection, dynamic\\nprogramming, cloud application, scientific application, big data.","authors":["H.
