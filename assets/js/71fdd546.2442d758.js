However, how faulty collective\\ncommunications impact the application and how errors prop-\\nagate between the application processes is largely unexplored.\\nOne of the critical reasons for this situation is the lack of fast\\nevaluation method to investigate the impacts of faulty collective\\noperations. The traditional random fault injection methods\\nrelying on a large amount of fault injection tests to ensure\\nstatistical significance require a significant amount of resources\\nand time. These methods result in prohibitive evaluation cost\\nwhen applied to the collectives.\\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel tool named Fast Fault\\nInjection and Sensitivity Analysis Tool (FastFIT) to conduct\\nfast fault injection and characterize the application sensitivity\\nto faulty collectives. The tool achieves fast exploration by\\nreducing the exploration space and predicting the application\\nsensitivity using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. A basis\\nfor these techniques are implicit correlations between MPI\\nsemantics, application context, critical application features,\\nand application responses to faulty collective communications.\\nThe experimental results show that our approach reduces\\nthe fault injection points and tests by 97% for represen-\\ntative benchmarks (NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB)) and a\\nrealistic application (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively\\nParallel Simulator (LAMMPS)) on a production supercomputer.\\nFurther, we statistically generalize the application sensitivity\\nto faulty collective communications for these workloads, and\\npresent correlation between application features and the sen-\\nsitivity.","authors":["K.
