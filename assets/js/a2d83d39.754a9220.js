This interest is due to the\\nfacts that data movement becomes prohibitively expensive, high-\\nperformance data analytic becomes an important part of HPC,\\nand Hadoop-based tools can perform large-scale data processing\\nin a time and budget efficient manner. In this study, we propose\\nPortHadoop, an enhanced Hadoop architecture that enables\\nMapReduce applications reading data directly from HPC parallel\\nfile systems (PFS). PortHadoop saves HDFS storage space, and,\\nmore importantly, avoids the otherwise costly data copying.\\nPortHadoop keeps all the semantics in the original Hadoop system\\nand PFS. Therefore, Hadoop MapReduce applications can run\\non PortHadoop without code change except that the input file\\nlocation is in PFS rather than HDFS. Our experimental results\\nshow that PortHadoop can operate effectively and efficiently with\\nthe PVFS2 and Ceph file systems.","authors":["X. Yang","N. Liu","B. Feng","X.-H. Sun","S.
