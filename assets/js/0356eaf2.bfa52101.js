Conventional performance environ-\\nments are based on profiling and event instrumentation. It\\nbecomes problematic as parallel systems scale to hun-\\ndreds of nodes and beyond. A framework of developing\\nan integrated performance modeling and prediction sys-\\ntem, SCALability Analyzer (SCALA), is presented in this\\nstudy. In contrast to existing performance tools, the pro-\\ngram performance model generated by SCALA is based\\non scalability analysis. SCALA assumes the availability\\nof modern compiler technology, adopts statistical and\\nsymbolic methodologies, and has the support of browser\\ninterface. These technologies, together with a new ap-\\nproach of scalability analysis, enable SCALA to provide\\nthe user with a more intuitive level of performance anal-\\nysis for scalable computing. A prototype SCALA system\\nhas been implemented. Initial experimental results show\\nthat SCALA is unique in its ability of revealing the scal-\\ning properties of a computing system.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","T. Fahringer","M.
