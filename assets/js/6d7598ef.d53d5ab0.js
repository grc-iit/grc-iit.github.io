Evaluating and\\nunderstanding memory system performance is increasingly\\nbecoming the core of high-end computing. Conventional memory\\nmetrics, such as miss ratio, average miss latency, average memory\\naccess time, etc., are designed to measure a given memory\\nperformance parameter, and do not reflect the overall performance\\nof a memory system. On the other hand, widely used system\\nmeasurement metrics, such as IPC and Flops are designed to\\nmeasure CPU performance, and do not directly reflect memory\\nperformance. In this paper, we proposed a novel memory metric,\\nAccess Per Cycle (APC), to measure overall memory performance\\nwith consideration of the complexity of modern memory systems.\\nA unique contribution of APC is its separation of memory\\nevaluation from CPU evaluation; therefore, it provides a\\nquantitative measurement of the \\"data-intensiveness\\" of an\\napplication. The concept of APC is introduced; a constructive\\ninvestigation counting the number of data accesses and access\\ncycles at differing levels of the memory hierarchy is conducted;\\nfinally some important usages of APC are presented. Simulation\\nresults show that APC is significantly more appropriate than\\nexisting memory metrics in evaluating modern memory systems.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","D.
