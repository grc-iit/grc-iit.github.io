Execution time varies with system and problem size and an initially fast\\nimplementation may become slow when system and problem size scale up. This paper introduces the concept of range comparison.\\nUnlike conventional execution time comparison in which performance is compared for a particular system and problem size, range\\ncomparison compares the performance of programs over a range of ensemble and problem sizes via scalability and performance\\ncrossing point analysis. A novel algorithm is developed to predict the crossing point automatically. The correctness of the algorithm is\\nproven and a methodology is developed to integrate range comparison into restructuring compilations for data-parallel programming. A\\npreliminary prototype of the methodology is implemented and tested under Vienna Fortran Compilation System. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that range comparison is feasible and effective. It is an important asset for program evaluation, restructuring compilation,\\nand parallel programming.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","M. Pantano","T.
