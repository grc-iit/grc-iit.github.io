Previous research focused on quantify-\\ning network transfer costs has indirectly resulted in reduced overall communication cost.\\nOptimized data transfer from source memory to the network interface has received less\\nattention. In shared memory systems, such memory-to-memory transfers dominate com-\\nmunication cost. In distributed memory systems, memory-to-network interface transfers\\ngrow in significance as processor and network speeds increase at faster rates than mem-\\nory latency speeds. Our objective is to minimize the cost of internal data transfers. The\\nfollowing examples illustrating the impact of memory transfers on communication, we\\npresent a methodology for classifying the effects of data size and data distribution on\\nhardware, middleware, and application software performance. This cost is quantified\\nusing hardware counter event measurements on the SGI Origin 2000. For the SGI O2K,\\nwe empirically identify the cost caused by just copying data from one buffer to another\\nand the middleware overhead. We use MPICH in our experiments, but our techniques\\nare generally applicable to any communication implementation.\\n","authors":["S. Byna","K. Cameron","X.-H.
