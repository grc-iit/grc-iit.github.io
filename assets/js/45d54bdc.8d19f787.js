In industry these services are referred to as infra-\\nstructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS),\\nand software as a service (SaaS). Mainstream ICT power-\\nhouses such as Amazon, HP, and IBM are heavily investing\\nin the provision and support of public cloud infrastructure.\\nCloud computing is rapidly becoming a popular infrastruc-\\nture of choice among all types of organisations. Despite\\nsome initial security concerns and technical issues, an\\nincreasing number of organisations have moved their appli-\\ncations and services in to \u201cThe Cloud\u201d. These applications\\nrange from generic word processing software to online\\nhealthcare. The cloud system taps into the processing power\\nof virtualized computers on the back end, thus significantly\\nspeeding up the application for the user, which just pays for\\nthe used services.\\nBig Data [2], [3], [4], [5] applications has become a com-\\nmon phenomenon in domain of science, engineering, and\\ncommerce. Some of the representative applications include\\ndisaster management, high energy physics, genomics, con-\\nnectomics, automobile simulations, medical imaging, and\\nthe like. The \\"BigData\\" problem, which is defined as the\\npractice of collecting and analyzing complex data sets so\\nlarge that it becomes difficult to analyse and interpret\\nmanually or using on-hand data management applications\\n(e.g., Microsoft Excel). For example, in case of disaster\\nmanagement Big Data application there is a need to ana-\\nlyse \\"a deluge of online data from multiple sources\\n(feeds from social media and mobile devices)\\" for under-\\nstanding and managing real-life events such as flooding,\\nearthquake, etc. Over 20 million tweets posted during\\nHurricane Sandy (2012) lead to an instance of the BigData\\nproblem. The statistics provided by the PearAnalytics\\nstudy reveal that almost 44 percent of the Twitter posts\\nare spam and pointless, about 6 percent are personal or\\nproduct advertising, while 3.6 percent are news and\\n37.6 percent are conversational posts. During the 2010\\nHaiti earthquake, text messaging via mobile phones and\\nTwitter made headlines as being crucial for disaster\\nresponse, but only some 100,000 messages were actually\\nprocessed by government agencies due to lack of auto-\\nmated and scalable ICT (cloud) infrastructure.\\nLarge-scale, heterogeneous, and uncertain Big Data\\napplications are becoming increasingly common, yet cur-\\nrent cloud resource provisioning methods do not scale well\\nand nor do they perform well under highly unpredictable\\nconditions (data volume, data variety, data arrival rate,\\netc.). Much research effort have been paid in the fundamen-\\ntal understanding, technologies, and concepts related to\\nautonomic provisioning of cloud resources for Big Data\\napplications, to make cloud-hosted Big Data applications\\noperate more efficiently, with reduced financial and envi-\\nronmental costs, reduced under-utilisation of resources,\\nand better performance at times of unpredictable workload.\\nTargeting the aforementioned research challenges, this\\nspecial issue compiles recent advances in Autonomic Provi-\\nsioning [6], [7] of Big Data Applications on Clouds.\\nFollowing papers put their focus on infrastructure level\\nCloud management for optimizing big data flow processing:\\n\u2022\\nVirtualized clouds introduce performance variability\\nin resources, thereby impacting the application\'s\\nability to meet its quality of service (QoS). This moti-\\nvates the need for autonomic methods of provision-\\ning elastic resources as well as dynamic task\\nselection, for continuous dataflow applications on\\nclouds. Kumbhare et al. extend continuous dataflows\\nto the concept of \u201cdynamic dataflows\u201d, which utilize\\nalternate tasks definitions and offer additional con-\\ntrol over the dataflow\'s cost and QoS. They formalize\\nan optimization problem to automate both deploy-\\nment time and runtime cloud resource provisioning\\nof such dynamic dataflows that allows for trade-offs\\nbetween the application\'s value and the resource\\ncost. They propose two greedy heuristics, centralized\\nand shared, based on the variable sized bin\\npacking algorithm to solve this NP-hard problem.\\nFurther, they also present a genetic algorithm (GA)","authors":["R.
