Until recently this has been sufficient, however as\\nsystems get larger, other metrics like power consumption become\\nnecessary to ensure system stability.\\nIn this paper, we propose a data driven scheduling approach\\nfor controlling the power consumption of the entire system under\\nany user defined budget. Here, \\"data driven\\" means that our ap-\\nproach actively observes, analyzes, and assesses power behaviors\\nof the system and user jobs to guide scheduling decisions for\\npower management. This design is based on the key observation\\nthat HPC jobs have distinct power profiles. Our work contains\\nan empirical analysis of workload power characteristics on a\\nproduction system, dynamic learner to estimate the job power\\nprofile for scheduling, and an online power-aware scheduler for\\nmanaging the overall system power. Using real workload traces,\\nwe demonstrate that our design effectively controls system power\\nconsumption while minimizing the impact on system utilization.","authors":["S. Wallace","X. Yang","V.
