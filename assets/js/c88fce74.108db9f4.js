The NGN, resulting from the merger of\\ntelecommunications, Information Technology (IT) and the Internet would provide on-demand, always-on\\nservices to its users. Service providers were to be affected by the increase in revenues paid by the users\\nof these new services. Equipment vendors would have a difficult time keeping inventories of the NGN\\ninfrastructure. The truth has been somewhat different. In this paper, we characterize a set of\\nconstraining forces and as well as some positive facilitating forces acting on the NGN.","authors":["V. K. Gurbani","A. Brusilovsky","X.-H.
