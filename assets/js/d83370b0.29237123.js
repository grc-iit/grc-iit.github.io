New hardware technologies, such as NVMe and SSD, have\\nbeen introduced in burst buffer installations to reduce the pressure\\nfor external storage and boost the burstiness of modern I/O systems.\\nThe DMSH has demonstrated its strength and potential in practice.\\nHowever, each layer of DMSH is an independent heterogeneous\\nsystem and data movement among more layers is significantly\\nmore complex even without considering heterogeneity. How to\\nefficiently utilize the DMSH is a subject of research facing the HPC\\ncommunity. In this paper, we present the design and implementa-\\ntion of Hermes: a new, heterogeneous-aware, multi-tiered, dynamic,\\nand distributed I/O buffering system. Hermes enables, manages, su-\\npervises, and, in some sense, extends I/O buffering to fully integrate\\ninto the DMSH. We introduce three novel data placement policies\\nto efficiently utilize all layers and we present three novel techniques\\nto perform memory, metadata, and communication management\\nin hierarchical buffering systems. Our evaluation shows that, in ad-\\ndition to automatic data movement through the hierarchy, Hermes\\ncan significantly accelerate I/O and outperforms by more than 2x\\nstate-of-the-art buffering platforms.","authors":["A.
