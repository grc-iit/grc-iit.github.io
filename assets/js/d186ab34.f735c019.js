In our design, pro-\\ncesses in distributed computation communicate one another\\nvia message passing and are migration-enabled. Due to mo-\\nbility, mechanisms to maintain reliability and correctness of\\ndata communication are needed. Following an event-based\\napproach, such mechanisms are derived to handle various\\ncommunication situations when a process migrates. These\\nmechanisms collectively preserve the semantics of the com-\\nmunication and support efficient communication state trans-\\nfer.","authors":["K. Chanchio","X.-H.
