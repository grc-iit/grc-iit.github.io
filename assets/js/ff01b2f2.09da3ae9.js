On these networks, how-\\never, interference caused by resource sharing can lead to sig-\\nnificant network congestion and performance variability. We\\npresent a comparative analysis exploring the trade-off between\\nlocalizing communication and balancing network traffic. We\\nconduct trace-based simulations for applications with different\\ncommunication patterns, using multiple job placement policies\\nand routing mechanisms. We perform an in-depth performance\\nanalysis on representative applications individually and show\\nthat different applications have distinct preferences regarding\\nlocalized communication and balanced network traffic. We fur-\\nther demonstrate the effect of external network interference by\\nintroducing background traffic and show that localized commu-\\nnication can help reduce the application performance variation\\ncaused by network sharing.","authors":["X.
