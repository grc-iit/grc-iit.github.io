In this study,\\nwe thoroughly evaluate the performance of such device and the\\nenergy requirements to operate it. The results show that first it\\nis a viable solution to offload data-intensive computations on the\\nOED while maintaining a reasonable performance, and second,\\nthe energy consumption savings from utilizing such technology\\nare significant as it only consumes 10% of the power needed by\\na normal server node. We propose that by using OED devices as\\nstorage servers in HPC, we can run a reliable, scalable, cost and\\nenergy efficient storage solution.","authors":["A. Kougkas","A. Fleck","X.-H.
