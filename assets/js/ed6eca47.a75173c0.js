However,\\ninclusion in the model of message characteristics and\\ncomplex memory hierarchies may result in impractical\\nmodels. Nonetheless, the growing gap between memory\\nand CPU performance combined with the trend toward\\nlarge scale clustered shared memory platforms implies an\\nincreased need to consider the impact of local memory\\ncommunication on parallel processing in distributed\\nsystems. We present a simple and useful model of point-\\nto-point memory communication to predict and analyze\\nthe latency of memory copy, pack and unpack. We use the\\nmodel to isolate contributions of hardware, middleware,\\nand software to data transfers on Intel- and MIPS-based\\nplatforms.","authors":["K. Cameron","X.-H.
