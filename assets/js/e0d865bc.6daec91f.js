Prefetch-\\ning, where data is fetched before CPU demands for it, has been considered as an effective solution to masking data\\naccess delay. However, current client-initiated prefetching strategies, where a computing processor initiates prefetching\\ninstructions, have many limitations. They do not work well for applications with complex, non-contiguous data access\\npatterns. While technology advances continue to increase the gap between computing and data access performance,\\ntrading computing power for reducing data access delay has become a natural choice. In this paper, we present a server-\\nbased data-push approach and discuss its associated implementation mechanisms. In the server-push architecture, a\\ndedicated server called Data Push Server (DPS) initiates and proactively pushes data closer to the client in time. Issues,\\nsuch as what data to fetch, when to fetch, and how to push are studied. The SimpleScalar simulator is modified with a\\ndedicated prefetching engine that pushes data for another processor to test DPS based prefetching. Simulation results\\nshow that L1 Cache miss rate can be reduced by up to 97% (71% on average) over a superscalar processor for SPEC\\nCPU2000 benchmarks that have high cache miss rates.","authors":["X.-H.
