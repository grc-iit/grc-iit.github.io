Traditional storage systems\\nwere not designed with an append-only data model and a\\nnew storage abstraction aims to fill this gap: the distributed\\nshared log store. However, existing solutions struggle to provide\\na scalable, parallel, and high-performance solution that can\\nsupport a diverse set of conflicting log workload requirements.\\nFinding the tail of a distributed log is a centralized point of\\ncontention. In this paper, we show how using physical time can\\nhelp alleviate the need of centralized synchronization points. We\\npresent ChronoLog, a new, distributed, shared, and multi-tiered\\nlog store that can handle more than a million tail operations\\nper second. Evaluation results show ChronoLog\'s potential,\\noutperforming existing solution by an order of magnitude.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","K. Bateman","J. Cernuda","N. Rajesh","X.-H.
