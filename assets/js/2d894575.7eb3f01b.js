Although there have been numerous techniques proposed to optimize the virtual network allocation in\\ndata center, the research on coordinating them in a flexible and effective way to autonomically adapt to the workloads for service time\\nreduction is few and far between. To address these issues, in this article we propose Sova, an autonomic framework that can combine\\nthe virtual dynamic SR-IOV (DSR-IOV) and the virtual machine live migration (VLM) for virtual network allocations in data centers.\\nDSR-IOV is a SR-IOV-based virtual network allocation technology, but its operation scope is very limited to a single physical machine,\\nwhich could lead to the local hotspot issue in the course of computation and communication, likely increasing the service response\\ntime. In contrast, VLM is an often-used virtualization technique to optimize global network traffic via VM migration. Sova exploits the\\nsoftware-defined approach to combine these two technologies with reducing the service response time as a goal. To realize the\\nautonomic coordination, the architecture of Sova is designed based on the MAPE-K loop in autonomic computing. With this design,\\nSova can adaptively optimize the network allocation between different services by coordinating DSR-IOV and VLM in autonomic way,\\ndepending on the resource usages of physical servers and the network characteristics of VMs. To this end, Sova needs to monitor the\\nnetwork traffic as well as the workload characteristics in the cluster, whereby the network properties are derived on the fly to direct the\\ncoordination between these two technologies. Our experiments show that Sova can exploit the advantages of both techniques to match\\nand even beat the better performance of each individual technology by adapting to the VM workload changes.","authors":["Z.
