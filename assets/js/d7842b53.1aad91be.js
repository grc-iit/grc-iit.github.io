Data prefetching is a well-known technique for\\nhiding read latency. However, existing solutions do not consider\\nthe new deep memory and storage hierarchy and also suffer\\nfrom under-utilization of prefetching resources and unnecessary\\nevictions. Additionally, existing approaches implement a client-\\npull model where understanding the application\'s I/O behavior\\ndrives prefetching decisions. Moving towards exascale, where\\nmachines run multiple applications concurrently by accessing\\nfiles in a workflow, a more data-centric approach can resolve\\nchallenges such as cache pollution and redundancy. In this\\nstudy, we present HFetch, a truly hierarchical data prefetcher\\nthat adopts a server-push approach to data prefetching. We\\ndemonstrate the benefits of such an approach. Results show 10-\\n35% performance gains over existing prefetchers and over 50%\\nwhen compared to systems with no prefetching.","authors":["H. Devarajan","A. Kougkas","X.-H.
