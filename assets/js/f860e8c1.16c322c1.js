There are two well-known\\nnumerical approaches towards the implementation of AMR-\\nbased cosmology simulations: block-based AMR and cell-based\\nAMR. While many studies have been conducted to improve\\nperformance and scalability of block-structured AMR appli-\\ncations, little work has been done for cell-based simulations.\\nIn this study, we present a parallel IO design for cell-based\\nAMR cosmology applications, in particular, the ART(Adaptive\\nRefinement Tree) code. First, we design a new data format that\\nincorporates a space filling curve to map between spatial and\\non-disk locations. This indexing not only enables concurrent IO\\naccesses from multiple application processes, but also allows\\nusers to extract local regions without significant additional\\nmemory, CPU or disk space overheads. Second, we develop a\\nflexible N-M mapping mechanism to harvest the benefits of N-N\\nand N-1 mappings where N is number of application processes\\nand M is a user-tunable parameter for number of files. It not\\nonly overcomes the limited bandwidth issue of an N-1 mapping\\nby allowing the creation of multiple files, but also enables users\\nto efficiently restart the application at a variety of computing\\nscales. Third, we develop a user-level library to transparently\\nand automatically aggregate small IO accesses per process to\\naccelerate IO performance. We evaluate this new parallel IO\\ndesign by means of real cosmology simulations on production\\nHPC system at TACC. Our preliminary results indicate that\\nit can not only provide the functionality required by scientists\\n(e.g., effective extraction of local regions and flexible process-to-\\nfile mapping), but also significantly improve IO performance.","authors":["Y.
