However, most existing ReRAM-based\\naccelerators are designed with homogeneous crossbars, leading to\\neither low resource utilization or sub-optimal energy efficiency.\\nIn this paper, we propose AUTOHET, an automated heterogeneous\\nReRAM-based accelerator with varied-size crossbars for different\\nDNN layers. To achieve both high crossbar utilization and energy\\nefficiency, AUTOHET uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to\\nautomatically determine the proper crossbar configuration for each\\nDNN layer. Additionally, AUTOHET introduces rectangle crossbars\\nand a tile-shared crossbar allocation scheme to reduce crossbar\\nwastage and energy consumption. Experiment results show that\\nAUTOHET effectively improves crossbar utilization by up to 3.1\xd7\\nand reduces energy consumption by up to 94.6%, compared to ap-\\nproaches with homogeneous ReRAM crossbars.","authors":["T.
