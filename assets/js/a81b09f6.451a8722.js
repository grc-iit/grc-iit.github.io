The idea of memory-based checkpointing has been\\nextensively studied in research but made little success in\\npractice due to its complexity and potential reliability concerns.\\nIn this study we present the design and implementation of\\nREMEM, a REmote MEMory checkpointing system to extend\\nthe checkpointing storage from disk to remote memory. A\\nunique feature of REMEM is that it can be integrated into\\nexisting disk-based checkpointing systems seamlessly. A user\\ncan flexibly switch between REMEM and disk as checkpointing\\nstorage to balance the efficiency and reliability. The imple-\\nmentation of REMEM on Open MPI is also introduced. The\\nexperimental results confirm that REMEM and the proposed\\nadaptive checkpointing storage selection are promising in both\\nperformance, reliability and scalability.","authors":["H. Jin","X.-H.
