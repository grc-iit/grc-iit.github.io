While intensive efforts have been made in developing new memory technologies and in\\ndesigning special purpose machines, there is a lack of solutions for evaluating and utilizing recent hardware advancements to address\\nthe memory-wall problem in a systematic way. In this study, we present the memory Layered Performance Matching (LPM)\\nmethodology to provide a systematic approach for data access performance optimization. LPM uniquely presents and utilizes the data\\naccess concurrency, in addition to data access locality, in a memory hierarchical system. The LPM methodology consists of models\\nand algorithms, and is supported with a series of analytic results for its correctness. The rationale of LPM is to reduce the overall data\\naccess delay through the matching of data request rate and data supply rate at each layer of a memory hierarchy, with a balanced\\nconsideration of data locality, data concurrency, and latency hiding of data flow. Extensive experimentations on both physical platforms\\nand software simulators confirm our theoretical findings, and they show that the LPM approach can be applied in diverse computing\\nplatforms and can effectively guide performance optimization of memory systems.","authors":["Y.
