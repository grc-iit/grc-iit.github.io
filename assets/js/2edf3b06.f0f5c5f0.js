However, most existing implementations of collective I/O strategies are designed and optimized\\nfor homogeneous I/O systems. In practice, the homogeneity assumptions do not hold in heterogeneous parallel I/O systems, which\\nconsist of multiple HDD and SSD-based servers and become increasingly promising. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity-aware\\ncollective-I/O (HACIO) strategy to enhance the performance of conventional collective I/O operations. HACIO reorganizes the order of\\nI/O requests for each aggregator with awareness of the storage performance of heterogeneous servers, so that the hardware of the\\nsystems can be better utilized. We have implemented HACIO in ROMIO, a widely used MPI-IO library. Experimental results show that\\nHACIO can significantly increase the I/O throughputs of heterogeneous I/O systems.","authors":["S.
