To achieve good performance, users often employ\\nan iterative multistage tuning process to find an optimal I/O stack\\nconfiguration. However, an I/O stack contains multiple layers, such\\nas high-level I/O libraries, I/O middleware, and parallel file systems,\\nand each layer has many parameters. These parameters and layers\\nare entangled and influenced by each other. The tuning process is\\ntime-consuming and complex. In this work, we present TunIO, an AI-\\npowered I/O tuning framework that implements several techniques to\\nbalance the tuning cost and performance gain, including tuning the high-\\nimpact parameters first. Furthermore, TunIO analyzes the application\\nsource code to extract its I/O kernel while retaining all statements\\nnecessary to perform I/O. It utilizes a smart selection of high-impact\\nconfiguration parameters of the given tuning objective. Finally, it uses a\\nnovel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven early stopping mechanism to\\nbalance the cost and performance gain. Experimental results show that\\nTunIO leads to a reduction of up to \u2248 73% in tuning time while achieving\\nthe same performance gain when compared to H5Tuner. It achieves a\\nsignificant performance gain/cost of 208.4 MBps/min (I/O bandwidth for\\neach minute spent in tuning) over existing approaches under our testing.\\nIndex Terms-AI-powered I/O tuning, storage stack tuning, autotun-\\ning, source code transformations, and I/O performance optimization","authors":["N.
