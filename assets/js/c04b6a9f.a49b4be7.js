Recently, Hill and Marty presented a\\npessimistic view of multicore scalability. Their analysis was based on Amdahl\'s law (i.e. fixed-workload\\ncondition) and challenged readers to develop better models. In this study, we analyze multicore scalability\\nunder fixed-time and memory-bound conditions and from the data access (memory wall) perspective. We\\nuse the same hardware cost model of multicore chips used by Hill and Marty, but achieve very different\\nand more optimistic performance models. These models show that there is no inherent, immovable\\nupper bound on the scalability of multicore architectures. These results complement existing studies and\\ndemonstrate that multicore architectures are capable of extensive scalability.\\n\xa9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","authors":["X.-H.
