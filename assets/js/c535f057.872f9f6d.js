In this research, we introduce a concurrency-aware solution, the memory Sluice Gate Theory, for solving the outstanding memory wall problem. Sluice gates are designed to control data transfer at each memory layer dynamically, and a global control algorithm, named layered performance matching, is developed to match the data transfer request/supply at each memory layer thus matching the overall performance between the CPU and memory system. Formal theoretical analyses are given to show, with sufficient data access concurrency and hardware support, the memory wall impact can be reduced to the minimum. Experimental testing is conducted which confirm the theoretical findings.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","Y.-H.
