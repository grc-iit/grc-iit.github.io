We\\npropose to augment C-AMAT to take into consideration the idiosyncrasies of individual cache/memory\\ncomponents as well as their topological arrangement in the memory architecture design. Through trace-\\nbased simulation, we validate the augmented model and examine the memory system performance with\\ninsight unavailable using the original C-AMAT model.","authors":["H. Najafi","X.
