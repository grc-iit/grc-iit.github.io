However, developing parallel and distributed debugger is\\ndifficult. This is especially true for cluster computing where heterogeneity presents. In this paper, we first give a survey of the current\\ndebugging techniques and existing tools, and then present a client-server debugging model. Based on this model, we discuss the design and\\ndevelopment of a practical scalable distributed debugging system for cluster computing in detail, and give two case studies to show how\\nthe distributed debugging system efficiently supports debugging message-passing programs such as various MPI and PVM programs. The\\nnewly developed distributed debugger is based on the sequential debugger gdb and dbx. It has the capability of scaling to handle hundreds\\nof processes. Its interfaces are completely implemented in Java, and its graphical user interface is the same on all computing platforms. In\\naddition, it is portable, easy to learn and use.","authors":["X.
