Scientific data analysis often in-\\nvolves complex queries across distributed datasets, requiring ma-\\nnipulation of multiple primary variables and generating derived\\ndata that needs to be handled efficiently, creating challenges for\\napplications that need to parse many large datasets. Relying on\\nindividual applications to handle all intermediate data generally\\nleads to redundant computations across studies and unnecessary\\ndata transfers. In this paper, we investigate the performance of\\ndifferent approaches where applications define derived variables\\nas quantities of interest (QoIs) and offload the computation and\\ntransfer of these QoIs to the I/O library. This significantly reduces\\nredundancy and optimizes data movement across the distributed\\nstorage and processing infrastructure by allowing control over\\nwhen and where derived variables are computed. We present a\\ndetailed analysis of the performance-storage trade-offs associated\\nwith different solutions and showcase results for our study on\\ntwo large-scale datasets created from climate and combustion\\nsimulations.","authors":["A.
