However, managing the ever-increasing\\nnumber of levels in the memory hierarchy becomes increasingly\\ndifficult. The Disaggregated Memory System (DMS) architecture\\nwas introduced in recent years for better memory utilization. DMS\\nis a global memory pool between the local memories and storage.\\nTo leverage DMS, we need a better understanding of its perfor-\\nmance and how to exploit its full potential. In this study, we first\\npresent a DMS performance model for performance evaluation and\\nanalysis. We next conduct a thorough performance evaluation to\\nidentify application-DMS characteristics under different system\\nconfigurations. Experimental tests are conducted on the RAM Area\\nNetwork (RAN), a DMS implementation available at the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory, for performance evaluation. Then, the results\\nof performance experiments are presented along with an analysis of\\nthe pros and cons of the RAN-DMS design and implementation. The\\ncounterintuitive performance results for the K-means application\\nare analyzed at code-level to illustrate DMS performance. Finally,\\nbased on our findings, we present some discussions on future DMS\\ndesign and its potential on AI applications.","authors":["N. Zhang","B. Toonen","X.-H. Sun","B.
