We need a cohesive mechanism to effectively\\nintegrate at scale complex scientific data formats such as HDF5,\\nPnetCDF, ADIOS2, GNCF, and Silo into popular AI frameworks\\nsuch as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Caffe. To this end, we designed\\nStimulus, a data management library for ingesting scientific\\ndata effectively into the popular AI frameworks. We utilize the\\nStimOps functions along with StimPack abstraction to enable the\\nintegration of scientific data formats with any AI framework. The\\nevaluations show that Stimulus outperforms several large-scale\\napplications with different use-cases such as Cosmic Tagger (con-\\nsuming HDF5 dataset in PyTorch), Distributed FFN (consuming\\nHDF5 dataset in TensorFlow), and CosmoFlow (converting\\nHDF5 into TFRecord and then consuming that in TensorFlow)\\nby 5.3x, 2.9x, and 1.9\xd7 respectively with ideal I/O scalability up\\nto 768 GPUs on the Summit supercomputer. Through Stimulus,\\nwe can portably extend existing popular AI frameworks to\\ncohesively support any complex scientific data format and\\nefficiently scale the applications on large-scale supercomputers.","authors":["H.
