In this research, we propose,\\ndesign, and implement the NBP (Network Bandwidth\\nPredictor) for rapid network performance prediction.\\nNBP is a new system that employs a neural network\\nbased approach for network bandwidth forecasting.\\nThis system is designed to integrate with most\\nadvanced technologies. It employs the NWS (Network\\nWeather Service) monitoring subsystem to measure the\\nnetwork traffic, and provides an improved, more\\naccurate performance prediction than that of NWS,\\nespecially with applications with a network usage\\npattern. The NBP system has been tested on real time\\ndata collected by NWS monitoring subsystem and on\\ntrace files. Experimental results confirm that NBP has\\nan improved prediction.","authors":["A.
