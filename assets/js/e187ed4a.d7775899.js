Context-based prefetching has become a primary focus of study in\\nrecent years due to its general applicability. However, current context-based prefetchers only adopt the context analysis\\nof a single order, which suffers from low prefetching coverage and thus limits the overall prefetching effectiveness. Also,\\nexisting approaches usually consider the context of the address stream from a single instruction but not the context of the\\naddress stream from all instructions, which further limits the context-based prefetching effectiveness. In this study, we\\npropose a new context-based prefetcher called the Global-aware and Multi-order Context-based (GMC) prefetcher. The\\nGMC prefetcher uses multi-order, local and global context analysis to increase prefetching coverage while maintaining\\nprefetching accuracy. In extensive simulation testing of the SPEC-CPU2006 benchmarks with an enhanced CMP$im simu-\\nlator, the proposed GMC prefetcher was shown to outperform existing prefetchers and to reduce the data-access latency\\neffectively. The average Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) improvement of SPEC CINT2006 and CFP2006 benchmarks with\\nGMC prefetching was over 55% and 44% respectively.","authors":["Y. Chen","H. Zhu","P. C. Roth","H.
