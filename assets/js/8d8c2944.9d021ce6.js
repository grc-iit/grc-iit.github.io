To avoid cumbersome network transfers when sharing data, a new class of storage gateways map a subset of facility storage to a cloud counterpart and automatically manage data mirroring. However, the performance characteristics of accessing AWS\'s S3 from HPC systems using different methods and patterns remains poorly understood. This paper presents a roofline-based analysis of three S3 integration approaches: NFS-mounted AWS Storage Gateway, data migration through Storage Gateway, and direct S3 API transfers. We extend I/O roofline modeling to characterize operational intensity and bandwidth ceilings across varying data sizes and access patterns. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance differences between access methods, with POSIX I/O on NFS Storage Gateway achieving up to 6.4\xd7 higher bandwidth than other approaches for large transfers. The roofline analysis reveals distinct characteristics for each method, enabling informed selection of S3 integration strategies.","slug":"tang-2025-s3-roofline-c7bd"},{"title":"Analyzing I/O Patterns and Dataflow in HPC Workflows","authors":["M.

Although\\nthe increasing use of descriptive data formats (e.g., HDF5,\\nnetCDF) helps organize these datasets, it also introduces obscure\\nbottlenecks due to the need to translate high-level operations\\ninto file addresses and then into low-level I/O operations. To\\naddress this challenge, we introduce DaYu, a method and toolset\\nfor analyzing (a) semantic relationships between logical datasets\\nand file addresses, (b) how dataset operations translate into\\nI/O, and (c) the combination across entire workflows. DaYu\'s\\nanalysis and visualization enable the identification of critical\\nbottlenecks and the reasoning about remediation. We describe\\nour methodology and propose optimization guidelines. Evaluation\\non scientific workflows demonstrates up to a 3.7x performance\\nimprovement in I/O time for obscure bottlenecks. The time and\\nstorage overhead for DaYu\'s time-ordered data are typically\\nunder 0.2% of runtime and 0.25% of data volume, respectively.","authors":["M. Tang","J. Cernuda","J. Ye","L. Guo","N.

To\\nguide these decisions, this paper introduces data flow lifecycle anal-\\nysis. Workflows are commonly represented using directed acyclic\\ngraphs (DAGs). Data flow lifecycles (DFL) enrich task DAGs with\\ndata objects and properties that describe data flow and how tasks\\ninteract with that flow. Lifecycles enable analysis from several\\nimportant perspectives: task, data, and data flow. We describe rep-\\nresentation, measurement, analysis, visualization, and opportunity\\nidentification for DFLs. Our measurement is both distributed and\\nscalable, using space that is constant per data file. We use lifecycles\\nand opportunity analysis to reason about improved task placement\\nand reduced data movement for five scientific workflows with dif-\\nferent characteristics. Case studies show improvements of 15x, 1.9\xd7,\\nand 10-30x. Our work is implemented in the DataLife tool.","authors":["H. Lee","L. Guo","M. Tang","J. Firoz","N. Tallent","A. Kougkas","X.-H.
