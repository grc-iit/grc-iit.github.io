However, there are few studies on how concurrent\\nmemory accesses may affect prefetching effectiveness. When\\nthere are multiple concurrent memory requests, we can classify\\nthem into sub-classes by analyzing the overlapping relationship.\\nIn this work, we first propose pure prefetch coverage (PPC), a\\nnovel prefetching metric that can identify an accurate prefetch\\ncoverage under the concurrent memory access model. Then\\nwe propose APAC, an adaptive prefetch framework with PPC\\nmetric that can capture the dynamics of applications and adjust\\nthe prefetching aggressiveness. Our experimental results show\\nthat the PPC metric has a higher IPC correlation compared to\\nthe conventional prefetch coverage (PC) metric. For memory-\\nintensive single-thread benchmarks, APAC provides an average\\nperformance improvement by 17.3% and 5.9% compared to the\\nstate-of-the-art adaptive prefetch framework FDP and NST. In\\na multi-core system, APAC outperforms FDP and NST by 8.5%\\nand 5.0% IPC on average, respectively.","authors":["X. Lu","R. Wang","X.-H.
