Scientific workflows consist\\nof diverse applications (i.e., HPC simulations and BD analysis)\\neach with distinct representations of data that introduce a se-\\nmantic barrier between the two environments. To solve scientific\\nproblems at scale, accessing semantically different data from\\ndifferent storage resources is the biggest unsolved challenge. In\\nthis work, we aim to address a critical question: \\"How can we\\nexploit the existing resources and efficiently provide transparent\\naccess to data from/to both environments\\". We propose iNtelligent\\nI/O Bridging Engine (NIOBE), a new data integration framework\\nthat enables integrated data access for scientific workflows with\\nasynchronous I/O and data aggregation. NIOBE performs the\\ndata integration using available I/O resources, in contrast to\\nexisting optimizations that ignore the I/O nodes present on the\\ndata path. In NIOBE, data access is optimized to consider both\\nthe ongoing production and the consumption of the data in\\nthe future. Experimental results show that with NIOBE, an\\nintegrated scientific workflow can be accelerated by up to 10x\\nwhen compared to a no-integration baseline and by up to 133%\\ncompared to other state-of-the-art integration solutions.","authors":["K.
