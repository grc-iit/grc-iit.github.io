Scientists have proposed\\nthe placement of fast intermediate storage resources which aim\\nto mask the I/O penalties. To manage these resources, three core\\nsoftware abstractions are being used in leadership-class computing\\nfacilities: IO Forwarders, Burst Buffers, and Data Stagers. Yet, with\\nthe rise of multi-tenant deployment in HPC systems, these software\\nabstractions are: managed and maintained in isolation, leading to\\ninefficient interactions; allocated statically, leading to load imbalance;\\nexclusively bifurcated between the intermediate storage, leading to\\nunder-utilization of resources, and, in many cases, do not support\\nin-situ operations. To this end, we present HFlow, a new class of\\ndata forwarding system that leverages a real-time data movement\\nparadigm. HFlow introduces a unified data movement abstraction\\n(the ByteFlow) providing data-independent tasks that can be\\nexecuted anywhere and thus, enabling dynamic resource provisioning.\\nMoreover, the processing elements executing the ByteFlows are\\ndesigned to be ephemeral and, hence, enable elastic management of\\nintermediate storage resources. Our results show that applications\\nrunning under HFlow display an increase in performance of 3x when\\ncompared with state-of-the-art software solutions.\\nIndex Terms-Data streaming, I/O forwarding, elasticity,\\ndynamicity, multi-tenant, data-intensive, I/O,data pipeline, in-transit","authors":["J.
