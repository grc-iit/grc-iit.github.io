This approach may provide better cost/\\nperformance than tightly coupled multiprocessors. In practice,\\nthis approach often utilizes wasted cycles to run parallel jobs.\\nIn this paper we address the feasibility and limitation of such a\\nnondedicated parallel processing environment assuming worksta-\\ntion processes have priority over parallel tasks. We develop a sim-\\nple analytical model to predict parallel job response times. Our\\nmodel provides insight into how significantly workstation owner\\ninterference degrades parallel program performance. It forms a\\nfoundation for task partitioning and scheduling in a nondedicated\\nnetwork environment. A new term, task ratio, which relates the\\nparallel task demand to the mean service demand of nonparallel\\nworkstation processes, is introduced. We propose that task ra-\\ntio is a useful metric for determining how a parallel applications\\nshould be partitioned and scheduled in order to make efficient\\nuse of a nondedicated distributed system.","authors":["S.
