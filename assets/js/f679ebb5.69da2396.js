However, peak I/O performance is rarely\\nattained due to complex data access patterns of applications.\\nBased on the observation that the I/O performance of small\\nrequests is often limited by the request service rate, and the\\nperformance of large requests is limited by I/O bandwidth, we\\ntake into consideration both factors and propose a server-level\\nadaptive data layout strategy. The proposed strategy adopts\\ndifferent stripe sizes for different file servers according to the\\ndata access characteristics on each individual server. We let\\nthe file servers that can fully utilize bandwidth hold more data,\\nand the file servers that are limited with request service rate\\nhold less data. As a result, heavy-load servers can offload some\\ndata accesses to light-load servers for potential improvement\\nof I/O performance. We present a method to measure access\\ncost for each data block and then utilize an equal-depth\\nhistogram approach to distributed data blocks across multiple\\nservers adaptively, so as to balance data accesses on all file\\nservers. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that\\nthe proposed server-level adaptive layout strategy can improve\\nI/O performance by as much as 80.3% and is more appropriate\\nfor applications with complex data access patterns.","authors":["H.
