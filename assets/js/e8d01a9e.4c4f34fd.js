Cache partitioning techniques have been\\nstudied for decades to reduce interference between applications in\\na shared cache and provide performance and fairness guarantees.\\nHowever, there are few studies on how concurrent memory\\naccesses affect the effectiveness of partitioning. When concurrent\\nmemory requests exist, cache miss does not reflect concurrency\\noverlapping well. In this work, we first introduce pure misses\\nper kilo instructions (PMPKI), a metric that quantifies the\\ncache efficiency considering concurrent access activities. Then\\nwe propose Premier, a dynamically adaptive concurrency-aware\\ncache pseudo-partitioning framework. Premier provides insertion\\nand promotion policies based on PMPKI curves to achieve the\\nbenefits of cache partitioning. Finally, our evaluation of various\\nworkloads shows that Premier outperforms state-of-the-art cache\\npartitioning schemes in terms of performance and fairness.\\nIn an 8-core system, Premier achieves 15.45% higher system\\nperformance and 10.91% better fairness than the UCP scheme.","authors":["X.
