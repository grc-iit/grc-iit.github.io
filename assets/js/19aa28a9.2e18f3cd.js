The\\ndistributed debugger based on the sequential debugger\\ngdb or dbx can efficiently support debugging various\\nPVM and MPI programs, and its interfaces are\\nimplemented by Java. Therefore, it meets High\\nPerformance Debugging Standard\'s three general goals\\nconcerning parallel and distributed debuggers. In addition,\\nit is portable, easy to learn and easy to use.","authors":["X. Wu","Q. Chen","X.-H.
