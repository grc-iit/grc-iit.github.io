However, applications demonstrate diverse I/O\\nrequirements that can be better served by a multi-storage approach. Cur-\\nrent practice employs ephemeral storage systems running on either node-\\nlocal or shared storage resources. Yet, the burden of provisioning and\\nconfiguring intermediate storage falls solely on the users, while global job\\nschedulers offer little to no support for custom deployments. This lack of\\nsupport often leads to over- or under-provisioning of resources and poorly\\nconfigured storage systems. To mitigate this, we present LuxIO, an intelli-\\ngent storage resource provisioning and auto-configuration service. LuxIO\\nconstructs storage deployments configured to best match I/O require-\\nments. LuxIO-tuned storage services show performance improvements\\nup to 2x across common applications and benchmarks, while introducing\\nminimal overhead of 93.40 ms on top of existing job scheduling pipelines.\\nLuxIO improves resource utilization by up to 25% in select workflows.\\n","authors":["K.
