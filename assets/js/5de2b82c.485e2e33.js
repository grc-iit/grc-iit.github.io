GPM applications are memory-bound and can be accelerated by memory-centric computing systems, such as processing-in-memory (PIM). However, there are three primary challenges when it comes to accelerating GPM applications with PIM: (1) difficulty in utilizing locality, (2) heavy data movement, and (3) heavy comparison overhead due to pruning. To address these challenges, we propose AceMiner, a framework to accelerate GPM applications with a software and hardware co-design perspective using PIM. In AceMiner, we embed hybridCache, a novel in-DRAM cache system with lower access latency and optimized replacement policy, to leverage the potential locality and reduce data movement in PIM. Additionally, we introduce a comparison unit to address the huge pruning overhead. Experimental results show that AceMiner outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving speedups of 40.2% and 13.3% over NDMiner and DIMMining respectively, with less energy consumption and design overhead.","authors":["L.
