Wing proposed the concept of \u201ccomputational thinking,\u201d which has produced significant worldwide impacts on the education, research, and development of computer science. After more than a decade, we reexamine computational thinking, and find that a more general-thinking paradigm is urgently needed to address new challenges. More generally, we identify four foundational thinking patterns that will foster computer system innovations: historical thinking, computational thinking, data-centric thinking, and architectural thinking (HDCA). The combination of these four patterns forms a regular tetrahedron thinking paradigm, providing a unified framework for computer design innovations. This thinking paradigm will provide a reference model for researchers and practitioners to guide and boost the next wave of innovations in computer systems.","authors":["Y. Liu","X.-H. Sun","Y.
