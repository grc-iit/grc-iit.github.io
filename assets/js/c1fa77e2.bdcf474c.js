There is no\\nsuitable and commonly accepted definition of scalability metric for heterogeneous systems. Isospeed\\nscalability is a well-defined metric for homogeneous computing. This study extends the isospeed\\nscalability metric to general heterogeneous computing systems. The proposed isospeed-efficiency model\\nis suitable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous computing. Through theoretical analyses, we derive\\nmethodologies of scalability measurement and prediction for heterogeneous systems. Experimental\\nresults have verified the analytical results and confirmed that the proposed isospeed-efficiency scalability\\nworks well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.\\n\xa9 2008 Elsevier Inc.
