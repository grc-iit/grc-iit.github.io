Explicit-implicit domain decomposition\\n(EIDD) methods are globally noniterative, nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods, which,\\nwhen compared with Schwarz-algorithm-based parabolic solvers, are computationally and commu-\\nnicationally efficient for each simulation time step but suffer from small time step size restrictions.\\nBy adding a stabilization step to EIDD, the SEIDD methods retain the time-stepwise efficiency in\\ncomputation and communication of the EIDD methods but exhibit much better numerical stability.\\nThree SEIDD algorithms are presented in this paper, which are experimentally tested to show excel-\\nlent stability, computation and communication efficiencies, and high parallel speedup and scalability.","authors":["Y.
