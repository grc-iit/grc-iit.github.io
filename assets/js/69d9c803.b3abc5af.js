The C-AMAT model provides a recursive expression for the memory access delay and therefore can be\\nused for identifying the potential bottlenecks in a memory hierarchy. The LPM method transforms a global memory system\\noptimization into localized optimizations at each memory layer by matching the data access demands of the applications with\\nthe underlying memory system design. These three models have been proposed separately through prior efforts. This paper\\nreexamines the three models under one coherent mathematical framework. More specifically, we present a new memory-\\ncentric view of data accesses. We divide the memory cycles at each memory layer into four distinct categories and use them\\nto recursively define the memory access latency and concurrency along the memory hierarchy. This new perspective offers\\nnew insights with a clear formulation of the memory performance considering both locality and concurrency. Consequently,\\nthe performance model can be easily understood and applied in engineering practices. As such, the memory-centric approach\\nhelps establish a unified mathematical foundation for model-driven performance analysis and optimization of contemporary\\nand future memory systems.","authors":["J.
