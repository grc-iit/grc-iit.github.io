The relative performance of different\\nparallel implementations varies with machine architecture, system and\\nproblem size. How to compare different implementations over a wide\\nrange of machine architectures and problem sizes has never been well\\naddressed due to its difficulty. Scalability has been proposed in recent\\nyears to reveal scaling properties of parallel algorithms and machines. In\\nthis paper, based on scalability analysis, the concepts of crossing point\\nanalysis and range comparison are introduced. Crossing point analysis\\nfinds slow/fast performance crossing points of parallel algorithms and\\nmachines. Range comparison compares performance over a wide range\\nof ensemble and problem size via scalability and crossing point analysis.\\nThree algorithms from scientific computing are implemented on an Intel\\nParagon and an IBM SP2 parallel computer. Experimental and theoret-\\nical results show the combination of scalability, crossing point analysis,\\nand range comparison provides a practical solution for scalable perfor-\\nmance evaluation. While our testings are conducted on homogeneous\\nparallel computers, the proposed methodology applies to heterogeneous\\nand network computing as well.","authors":["X.-H.
