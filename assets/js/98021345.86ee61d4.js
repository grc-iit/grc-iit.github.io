FENCE is a comprehensive fault management\\nsystem in the sense that it consists of both post and runtime analysis, integrates both proactive and reactive\\nmechanisms, and combines both application level and system level fault management. Component-based systems\\nare also developed to support the comprehensive FENCE design. Preliminary implementation results are presented.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","Z. Lan","Y. Li","H. Jin","Z.
