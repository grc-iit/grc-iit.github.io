The next\\ngeneration of Hadoop, Apache Hadoop YARN, is designed to\\naddress these issues. In this paper, we propose YARNsim, a\\nsimulation system for Hadoop YARN. YARNsim is based on\\nparallel discrete event simulation and provides protocol-level\\naccuracy in simulating key components of YARN. YARNsim\\nprovides a virtual platform on which system architects can\\nevaluate the design and implementation of Hadoop YARN\\nsystems. Also, application developers can tune job performance\\nand understand the tradeoffs between different configurations,\\nand Hadoop YARN system vendors can evaluate system\\nefficiency under limited budgets.\\nTo demonstrate the validity of YARNsim, we use it to model\\ntwo real systems and compare the experimental results from\\nYARNsim and the real systems. The experiments include\\nstandard Hadoop benchmarks, synthetic workloads, and a\\nbioinformatics application. The results show that the error rate is\\nwithin 10% for the majority of test cases. The experiments prove\\nthat YARNsim can provide what-if analysis for system designers\\nin a timely manner and at minimal cost compared with testing\\nand evaluating on a real system.","authors":["N.
