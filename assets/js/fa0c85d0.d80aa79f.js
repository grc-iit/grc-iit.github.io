However, due to its poor locali-\\nty and complex data access patterns, graph processing is also a known performance killer of AI and big data applications.\\nIn this work, we propose to enhance graph processing applications by leveraging fine-grained memory access patterns with\\na dual-path architecture on top of existing software-based graph optimizations. We first identify that memory accesses to\\nthe offset, edge, and state array have distinct locality and impact on performance. We then introduce the Skyway architec-\\nture, which consists of two primary components: 1) a dedicated direct data path between the core and memory to transfer\\nstate array elements efficiently, and 2) a data-type aware fine-grained memory-side row buffer hardware for both the new-\\nly designed direct data path and the regular memory hierarchy data path. The proposed Skyway architecture is able to im-\\nprove the overall performance by reducing the memory access interference and improving data access efficiency with a\\nminimal overhead. We evaluate Skyway on a set of diverse algorithms using large real-world graphs. On a simulated four-\\ncore system, Skyway improves the performance by 23% on average over the best-performing graph-specialized hardware\\noptimizations.","authors":["M. Zou","M. Zhang","R.
