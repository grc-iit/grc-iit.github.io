Reservation mechanisms have been used\\nto reserve resources for external applications through\\nservice level agreements between local resource\\norganizations and external applications. However, the\\neffects of resource reservation on local applications,\\nand therefore the trustfulness of the successful\\nfulfillment of the service agreement, have been\\nignored. In this paper, we investigate the effect of\\nresource reservation on external applications as well\\nas local jobs, and design efficient task scheduling\\nalgorithms considering the tolerance of local jobs to\\nresource reservation. Extensive simulations and\\nimplementation experiments have been carried out to\\nconfirm our analysis results. Experimental results\\nshow that the relative slowdown metric and the failure-\\nminimization scheduling algorithms proposed in this\\nstudy are practically effective and have a real\\npotential.","authors":["M.
