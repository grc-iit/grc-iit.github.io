In these systems, checkpointing\\ngenerates a huge number of concurrent I/O writes. The burst\\nof writes plus the worsening I/O-wall problem often leads to\\nnetwork and I/O congestion, and makes the overall system\\nperformance painfully slow. Recognizing contention as a\\ndominant performance factor, in this paper we propose a\\nsystematic approach named checkpointing orchestration to\\nreduce write contention, which combines the marshaling of\\nconcurrent checkpoint requests and the adopting of vertical\\ndata access in coordination. A prototype of the proposed\\ncheckpointing orchestration approach has been implemented\\nat the system-level under Open MPI over the PVFS2 file\\nsystem. Extensive experiments based on NPB benchmarks\\nhave been conducted to verify the design and implementation.\\nExperimental results show that checkpointing orchestration\\nreduced the checkpointing cost at a degree of more than 30%.\\nCheckpointing cost was halved for 4 out of 5 the C class NPB\\nbenchmarks.","authors":["H.
