However, limited device memory\\nis an obvious bottleneck in executing many GPU tasks.\\nAnd the task priority and system performance are often\\nignored. To address these, a real-time GPU scheduling\\nscheme is proposed in this paper. A reservation algorithm\\nbased on device memory(RBDM) is adopted to provide more\\nopportunity for the High-priority task in the scheme. high\\npriority first wake (HPFW) and small memory HPFW (SM-\\nHPFW) are employed in the scheduling of waiting tasks to\\nimprove the priority response time and system performance.\\nA CPU-based monitor is developed to check the GPU task\\nexecution. Experiments show the RBDM can work effec-\\ntively. Compared with FIFO, HPFW can decrease overall\\npriority response time significantly. Overall task completion\\ntime can be reduced by 20% using the SM-HPFW while the\\ndistribution of device memory requirement of GPU tasks is\\neven.","authors":["B. Xu","W. Zhang","X.-H. Sun","Y.
