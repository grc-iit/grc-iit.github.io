This\\nwork introduces HStream, a novel data management design for\\nout-of-core data streaming engines. Central to the HStream design\\nis the separation of data and computing planes at the task level. By\\nmanaging them independently, issues such as memory thrashing\\nand back-pressure, caused by the high volume, velocity, and bursti-\\nness of I/O in HPC environments, can be effectively addressed at\\nruntime. Specifically, HStream utilizes adaptive parallelism and hi-\\nerarchical memory management, enabled by this design paradigm,\\nto alleviate memory pressure and enhance system performance.\\nThese improvements enable HStream to match the performance of\\nstate-of-the-art HPC streaming engines and achieve up to a 1.5x\\nreduction in latency under high data loads.","authors":["J.
