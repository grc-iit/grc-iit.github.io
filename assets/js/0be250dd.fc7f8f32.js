Further, new hardware technologies and system designs\\ncreate a hierarchical composition that may be ideal for computational storage operations. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate how to support a wide variety of conflicting I/O workloads under a single storage system. We\\nintroduce the idea of a Label, a new data representation, and, we present LABIOS: a new, distributed, Label-\\nbased I/O system. LABIOS boosts I/O performance by up to 17x via asynchronous I/O, supports heterogeneous\\nstorage resources, offers storage elasticity, and promotes in-situ analytics and software defined storage support\\nvia data provisioning. LABIOS demonstrates the effectiveness of storage bridging to support the convergence\\nof HPC and BigData workloads on a single platform.","authors":["A. Kougkas","H. Devarajan","X.-H.
