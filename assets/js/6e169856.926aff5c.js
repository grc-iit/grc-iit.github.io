Cloud is designed on top of distributed file systems such as Google file system (GFS). The capability of running HPC applications on top of data-intensive file systems is a critical catalyst in promoting Clouds for HPC. However, the semantic gap between data-intensive file systems and HPC imposes numerous challenges. For example, N-1 (N to 1) is a widely used data access pattern for HPC applications such as checkpointing, but cannot perform well on data-intensive file systems.\\nIn this study, we propose the Chunk-Aware I/O (CHAIO) strategy to enable efficient N-1 data access on data-intensive distributed file systems. CHAIO reorganizes I/O requests to favor data-intensive file systems and avoid possible access contention. It balances the workload distribution and promotes data locality. We have tested the CHAIO design over the Kosmos file system (KFS). Experimental results show that CHAIO achieves a more than two-fold improvement in I/O bandwidth for both write and read operations. Experiments in large-scale environment confirm the potential of CHAIO for small and irregular requests. The aggregator selection algorithm works well to balance the workload distribution. CHAIO is a critical and necessary step to enable HPC in the Cloud.","authors":["H. Jin","J. Ji","X.-H. Sun","Y. Chen","R.
