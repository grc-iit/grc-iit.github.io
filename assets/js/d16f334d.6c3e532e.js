In\\nthis paper, a detailed study of the PDD algorithm is given. First the PDD algorithm is\\nextended to solve periodic tridiagonal systems and its scalability is studied. Then the\\nreduced PDD algorithm, which has a smaller operation count than that of the conventional\\nsequential algorithm for many applications, is proposed. Accuracy analysis is provided for a\\nclass of tridiagonal systems, the symmetric and skew-symmetric Toeplitz tridiagonal systems.\\nImplementation results show that the analysis gives a good bound on the relative error, and\\nthe PDD and reduced PDD algorithms are good candidates for emerging massively parallel\\nmachines.","authors":["X.-H.
