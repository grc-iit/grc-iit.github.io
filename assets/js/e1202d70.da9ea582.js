While utilizing data locality to enhance cache performance\\nbecomes more and more difficult, data access concurrency provides\\na new opportunity for cache performance optimization. In this\\nwork, we propose a novel concurrency-aware cache management\\nframework that outperforms state-of-the-art locality-only cache\\nmanagement schemes. First, we investigate the merit of data\\naccess concurrency and pinpoint that reducing the miss rate\\nmay not necessarily lead to better overall performance. Next, we\\nintroduce the pure miss contribution (PMC) metric, a lightweight\\nand versatile concurrency-aware indicator, to accurately measure\\nthe cost of each outstanding miss access by considering data\\nconcurrency. Then, we present CARE, a dynamic adjustable,\\nconcurrency-aware, low-overhead cache management framework\\nwith the help of the PMC metric. We evaluate CARE with\\nextensive experiments across different application domains and\\nshow significant performance gains with the consideration of data\\nconcurrency. In a 4-core system, CARE improves IPC by 10.3%\\nover LRU replacement. In 8 and 16-core systems where more\\nconcurrent data accesses exist, CARE outperforms LRU by 13.0%\\nand 17.1%, respectively.","authors":["X. Lu","R. Wang","X.-H.
