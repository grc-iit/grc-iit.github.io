Such problems arise in the solution process\\nof incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and in the time-harmonic wave propaga-\\ntion in the frequence space with the zero wavenumber. The equation is first discretized\\nwith a fourth order modified Collatz difference scheme, producing a singular discrete\\nequation. Then an efficient singular value decomposition (SVD) method modified\\nfrom a fast Poisson solver is employed to project the discrete singular equation into\\nthe orthogonal complement of the null space of the singular matrix. In the comple-\\nment of the null space, the projected equation is uniquely solvable and its solution is\\nproven to be a solution of the original singular discrete equation when the original\\nequation has a solution. Analytical and experimental results show that this newly\\nproposed singular equation solver is efficient while retaining the accuracy of the\\nhigh order discretization.\\n2001 Academic Press\\nKey Words: Poisson equation; Neumann boundary condition; SVD; fast Fourier\\ntransform (FFT); high order discretization.\\n\xa9","authors":["Y.
