Nonetheless, the growing gap between memory and CPU performance\\ncombined with the trend toward large-scale, clustered shared memory platforms implies an increased need to consider the impact of\\nmiddleware on distributed communication. We present a general software-parameterized model of point-to-point communication for\\nuse in performance prediction and evaluation. We illustrate the utility of the model in three ways: 1) to derive a simplified, useful, more\\naccurate model of point-to-point communication in clusters of SMPs, 2) to predict and analyze point-to-point and broadcast\\ncommunication costs in clusters of SMPs, and 3) to express, compare, and contrast existing communication models. Though our\\nmethods are general, we present results on several Linux clusters to illustrate practical use on real systems.","authors":["K. Cameron","G. Ge","X.-H.
