Data replication is a promising approach to improve parallel I/O performance. However,\\nmost existing strategies are designed based on the assumption that contiguous requests are being served more efficiently than\\nnon-contiguous requests, which is not necessarily true in a parallel I/O system. The reason is that the multiple-server data distribution\\nmakes the favorable accesses between contiguous requests and non-contiguous ones indeterminate. In this study, we propose CEDA,\\na cost-effective distribution-aware data replication scheme to better support parallel I/O systems. As logical file access information is\\ninefficient to make replication decisions in a parallel environment, CEDA considers physical data accesses on servers in both data\\nselection and data placement during a parallel replication process. Specifically, CEDA first proposes a distribution-aware cost model to\\nevaluate the file request time with a given data layout, and then it carries out cost-effective data replication based on replication benefit\\nanalysis. We have implemented CEDA as a part of the MPI I/O library in light of high portability on top of the OrangeFS file system.\\nBy replaying representative benchmarks and a real application, we collected comprehensive experimental results on both HDD- and\\nSSD-based servers and conclude that CEDA can significantly improve parallel I/O system performance.","authors":["S.
