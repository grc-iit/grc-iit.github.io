Scientists have adopted massively parallel computing\\nas a cost-effective way to achieve high computing power.\\nThey have introduced various architectures and algorithms\\nto deliver performance scalability with many processors. Shared virtual\\nmemory and other kinds of system support, which hide the communica-\\ntion and other implementation details from the user, are becoming more\\nprevalent. At the same time, with various architectures and algorithms\\navailable, performance prediction is becoming critical in choosing an\\nappropriate algorithm-machine pair for an application, especially when\\nthe machine has a sophisticated hierarchical architecture.\\nIn this article, we combine simple formulas with runtime information\\nto predict performance in modern parallel computers. After presenting a\\nsimple prediction formula, we discuss a case study involving a virtual\\nmemory machine to illustrate how to use the formula in practice. We dis-\\ncuss four different aspects:\\n\u2022 We propose a method to measure the needed runtime parameters.\\n\u2022 We propose an adjustment to catch the influence of architecture vari-\\nation when the system size is scaled up from one level of architecture\\nhierarchy to another.\\n\u2022 We demonstrate, through the case study, that it is possible to predict\\nthe influence of architecture hierarchy on scalability by simply using\\nhardware specifications.\\nFinally, we discuss the issue of choosing an appropriate algorithm for\\na given application when the computing system is scaled up from one\\nlevel of hierarchy to another.","authors":["X.-H.
