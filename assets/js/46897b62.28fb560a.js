With the emergence of solid state\\ndrives (SSD), hybrid PFSs, which consist of both HDD and SSD\\nservers, provide a practical I/O system solution for data-intensive\\napplications. However, most existing PFS layout schemes are\\ninefficient for hybrid PFSs due to their lack of awareness of the\\nperformance differences between heterogeneous servers and the\\nworkload changes between different parts of a file. This lack of\\nrecognition can result in severe I/O performance degradation. In\\nthis study, we propose a heterogeneity-aware region-level (HARL)\\ndata layout scheme to improve the data distribution of a hybrid\\nPFS. HARL first divides a file into fine-grained, varying sized\\nregions according to the changes of an application\'s I/O work-\\nload, then chooses appropriate file stripe sizes on heterogeneous\\nservers based on the server performance for each file region.\\nExperimental results of representative benchmarks show that\\nHARL can greatly improve the I/O system performance.","authors":["S.
