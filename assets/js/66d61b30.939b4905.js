Fat-tree networks\\nhave been widely used in both data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) systems in the past\\ndecades and are promising candidates of the next-generation extreme-scale networks. In this article, we\\npresent FatTreeSim, a simulation framework that supports modeling and simulation of extreme-scale fat-\\ntree networks with the goal of understanding the design constraints of next-generation HPC and distributed\\nsystems and aiding the design and performance optimization of the applications running on these systems.\\nWe have systematically experimented FatTreeSim on Emulab and Blue Gene/Q and analyzed the scalability\\nand fidelity of FatTreeSim with various network configurations. On the Blue Gene/Q Mira, FatTreeSim can\\nachieve a peak performance of 305 million events per second using 16,384 cores. Finally, we have applied\\nFatTreeSim to simulate several large-scale Hadoop YARN applications to demonstrate its usability.","authors":["N. Liu","A. Haider","D. Jin","X.-H.
