Existing research has often fo-\\ncused on individual techniques, overlooking the potential benefits\\nof joint optimization. Moreover, many of these approaches rely\\non static and intuition-driven policies, limiting their performance\\nunder complex and dynamic workloads. To address these chal-\\nlenges, this paper introduceesCHROME,a novelty\\naware cache management framework. CHROME takes a holistic\\napproach by seamlessly integrating intelligent cache replacement\\nand bypassing with pattern-based prefetching. By leveraging\\nonline reinforcement learning, CHROME dynamically adapts\\ncache decisions based on multiple program features and applies a\\nreward for each decision that considers the accuracy of the action\\nand the system-level feedback information. Our performance\\nevaluation demonstrates that CHROME outperforms current\\nstate-of-the-art schemes, exhibiting significant improvements in\\ncache management. Notably, CHROME achieves a remarkable\\nperformance boost of up to 13.7% over the traditional LRU\\nmethod in multi-core systems with only modest overhead.","authors":["X. Lu","H. Najafi","J.
