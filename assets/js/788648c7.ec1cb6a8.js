Accessing to\\ndistributed data is typically as important as access\\nto distributed computational resources. In this pa-\\nper, we present the design of Java CoG Kit compo-\\nnents and APIs that make handling of data accessed\\nthrough Grids easier for the novice Grid user and\\nprogrammer. We introduce the design and archi-\\ntecture of a component for file transfers that sep-\\narates issues related to requesting, performing and\\nvisualizing the actual file transfer. The design of\\nour component is based on object and component\\nbased methodologies. Hence, it is assembled from\\na collection of reusable components promoting cus-\\ntomization and reuse. We integrated the drag-and-\\ndrop paradigm. Protocol-independent interfaces al-\\nlow easy adaptation to a variety of data sources.\\nHence, we not only have developed a GUI but so-\\nphisticated middleware to develop advanced Grid\\nfile transfer services. These components are dis-\\ntributed with the Java CoG Kit.\\nKeywords: FTP, GridFTP, RFT, Grid","authors":["G. Laszewski","B. Alunkal","J. Gawor","R. Madhuri","P. Plaszezak","X.-H.
