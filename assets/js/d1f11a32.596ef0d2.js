Grid considers both static, unmovable hardware and\\nmoveable, replicable data as computing resources. While intensive research has\\nbeen done on task scheduling on hardware computing resources and on data\\nreplication protocols, how to incorporate data movement into task scheduling\\nseamlessly is unrevealed. We consider data movement as a dimension of task\\nscheduling. A dynamic data structure, Data Distance Table (DDT), is proposed\\nto provide real-time data distribution and communication information. Based on\\nDDT, a data-conscious task scheduling heuristics is introduced to minimize the\\ndata access delay. A simulated Grid environment is set up to test the efficiency\\nof the newly proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that for data\\nintensive tasks, the dynamic data-conscious scheduling outperforms the\\nconventional Min-Min significantly.","authors":["X. He","X.-H.
