Applications compiled for a particular architecture may be executed on vastly different memory hierarchy implemen-\\ntations. There is a need for performance analysis techniques that provide methods for understanding the interaction between\\napplications and a given memory hierarchy. In this paper, we present a statistical approach to performance analysis of ad-\\nvanced memory hierarchy implementations. The method involves the utilization of previously available statistical analysis\\ntechniques coupled with scalability analysis. The result is a novel step-wise approach to understanding the hierarchical mem-\\nory performance of scientific applications. We apply the method to several scientific applications of interest to the accelerated\\nstrategic computing initiative (ASCI) over the SGI machines PowerChallenge and Origin 2000. Results indicate some codes\\nare statistically identical in memory performance, while others vary greatly. Furthermore, some codes do not take advantage\\nof the performance enhancements to the memory system found in the Origin 2000. \xa9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
