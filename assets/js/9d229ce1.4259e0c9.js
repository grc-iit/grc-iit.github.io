With the emergence of solid state drives\\n(SSDs), hybrid PFS, which consists of both HDD and SSD servers, provides a practical I/O system solution for data-intensive\\napplications. However, most existing data layout schemes are inefficient for hybrid PFS due to their unawareness of server\\nheterogeneities and workload changes in different parts of a file. In this study, we propose a heterogeneity-aware region-level data\\nlayout scheme, HARL, to improve the data distribution of a hybrid PFS. HARL first divides a file into fine-grained, varying sized regions\\naccording to the workload features of an application, then determines appropriate file stripe sizes on servers for each region based on\\nthe performance of heterogeneous servers. Furthermore, to further improve the performance of a hybrid PFS, we propose a dynamic\\nregion-level layout scheme, HARL-D, which creates multiple replicas for each region and redirects file requests to the proper replicas\\nwith the lowest access costs at the runtime. Experimental results of representative benchmarks and a real application show that HARL\\ncan greatly improve I/O system performance, and demonstrate the advantages of HARL-D over HARL.","authors":["S.
