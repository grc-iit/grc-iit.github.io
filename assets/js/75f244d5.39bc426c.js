However, existing DNN training frameworks do not\\nhave a cache layer that reduces the number of data fetches and\\nmanages cached items according to sample importance, resulting\\nin unnecessary data fetches, poor cache hit ratios, and random\\nI/Os when importance sampling is used.\\nIn this paper, we design a new importance-sampling-informed\\ncache, namely, iCACHE, to accelerate I/O bound DNN training\\njobs. iCACHE only fetches parts of samples instead of all samples\\nin the dataset. The cache is partitioned into two regions: H-\\ncache and L-cache, which store samples of high importance\\nand low importance respectively. Rather than using recency or\\nfrequency, we manage data items in H-cache according to their\\ncorresponding sample importance. When there is a cache miss in\\nL-cache, we use sample substitutability and dynamic packaging\\nto improve the cache hit ratio and reduce the number of random\\nI/Os. When multiple concurrent jobs access the same datasets in\\nH-cache, we design a model to assign the relative importance\\nvalues to cached samples to avoid cache thrashing, which may\\nhappen when there is no coordination among the concurrent\\ntraining jobs. Our experimental results show that iCACHE has a\\nnegligible impact on training accuracy and speeds up the DNN\\ntraining time by up to 2.0\xd7 compared to the state-of-the-art\\ncaching systems.","authors":["W.
