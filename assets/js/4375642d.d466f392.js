One drawback to this metric is that it tends to reward slower processors and inefficient\\ncompilation with higher speedup. It seems unfair that the goals of high speed and high speedup are at odds with\\neach other. In this paper, the \'fairness\' of parallel performance metrics is studied. Theoretical and experimental\\nresults show that the most commonly used performance metric, parallel speedup, is \'unfair\', in that it favors\\nslow processors and poorly coded programs. Two new performance metrics are introduced. The first one, sizeup,\\nprovides a \'fair\' performance measurement. The second one is a generalization of speedup \u2013 the generalized\\nspeedup, which recognizes that speedup is the ratio of speeds, not times. The relation between sizeup, speedup,\\nand generalized speedup are studied. The various metrics have been tested using a real application that runs on\\nan nCUBE 2 multicomputer. The experimental results closely match the analytical results.","authors":["X.-H. Sun","J.
