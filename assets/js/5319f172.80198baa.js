However, computing\\nenvironments for developing tools to harness these technologies are\\nnot easily available to researchers. This work showcases the need for\\na new high-pace, heterogeneous I/O research cluster and presents a\\nnovel software deployment framework named Jarvis to manage its\\nhardware diversity. Jarvis is an extensible Python framework that\\nallows users to create Packages that deploy, manage, and monitor\\nsoftware, including complex applications (e.g., scientific simulations),\\nsupport tools (e.g., Darshan, GDB), and storage systems (e.g.,\\nLustre, DAOS). These packages can be combined to form complex\\ndeployment Pipelines. To ensure pipelines are portable across\\nhardware, Jarvis defines a novel Resource Graph schema file,\\nwhich is a snapshot of a cluster\'s machine-specific information.\\nThis schema can be queried by Jarvis packages to deploy software\\nacross diverse hardware compositions with minimal user effort.\\nIndex Terms-deployment, HPC, hardware abstraction, resource\\nmanagement, I/O, Python","authors":["J.
