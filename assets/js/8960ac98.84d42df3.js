However, the effectiveness\\ndepends on determining patterns among future I/O accesses\\nswiftly and fetching data in time, which is difficult to achieve in\\ngeneral. In this study, we propose an I/O signature-based\\nprefetching strategy. The idea is to use a predetermined I/O\\nsignature of an application to guide prefetching. To put this idea\\nto work, we first derived a classification of patterns and\\nintroduced a simple and effective signature notation to represent\\npatterns. We then developed a toolkit to trace and generate I/O\\nsignatures automatically. Finally, we designed and implemented a\\nthread-based client-side collective prefetching cache layer for\\nMPI-IO library to support prefetching. A prefetching thread\\nreads I/O signatures of an application and adjusts them by\\nobserving I/O accesses at runtime. Experimental results show\\nthat the proposed prefetching method improves I/O performance\\nsignificantly for applications with complex patterns.","authors":["S. Byna","Y. Chen","X.-H. Sun","R.
