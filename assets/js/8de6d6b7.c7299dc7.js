We consider\\nall manner of cellular endpoints: 2G, 2.5G, and early 3G endpoints.\\nThese extensions allow the PSTN endpoints to act as smart SIP user\\nagents and participate in Internet-oriented services such as presence\\nand instant messaging (IM) without the endpoint itself being\\nconnected to the Internet. For cellular networks, our methodology\\nconserves precious radio spectrum by offloading such data services\\nfrom the bandwidth normally allocated to voice. Our approach is\\nbased on open standards and is not an ad-hoc or incremental solution.","authors":["V. K. Gurbani","X.-H.
