Then, novel methods are developed to\\nincorporate the MSR model into a process, and to collect and restore data efficiently. We have implemented\\nprototype software and performed experiments on different programs. Experimental and analytical results\\nshow that: (1) a user-level process can be migrated across different computing platforms; (2) semantic\\ninformation of data structures in the process\'s memory space can be correctly collected and restored;\\n(3) costs of data collection and restoration depend on the complexity of the MSR graph in the memory\\nspace and the amount of data involved; and (4) the implantation of the MSR model into the process is not\\na decisive factor of incurring execution overheads. With appropriate program analysis, we can practically\\nachieve low overhead.","authors":["K. Chanchio","X.-H.
