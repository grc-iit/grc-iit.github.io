In\\nthis study, we propose a novel hybrid shared-nothing/shared-data\\nstorage scheme for large-scale databases, to leverage the benefits\\nof both shared-nothing and shared-disk architectures. We adopt\\na shared-nothing architecture as the hardware layer and leverage\\na parallel file system as the storage layer. The proposed hybrid\\nstorage scheme can provide a high degree of parallelism in both\\nI/O and computing, like that in a shared-nothing system. In the\\nmeantime, it can achieve convenient and high-speed data sharing\\nacross multiple database nodes, like that in a shared-disk system.\\nThe hybrid scheme is more appropriate for large-scale and data-\\nintensive applications than each of the two individual types of\\nsystems.","authors":["H.
