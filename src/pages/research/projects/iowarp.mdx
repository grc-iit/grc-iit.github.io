### AI Agents for Scientific Computing

Following Anthropic's November 2024 release of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), IOWarp has pioneered the integration of AI agents into scientific computing environments. These agents can:

- **Understand Scientific Data**: Parse and analyze data from formats like HDF5, Adios BP5, NetCDF
- **Orchestrate Workflows**: Submit jobs, manage resources, and coordinate multi-step computational pipelines
- **Generate Insights**: Perform data analysis, create visualizations, and answer scientific queries
- **Ensure Reproducibility**: Track provenance and enable replay of complex workflows

### Model Context Protocols for Science

    alt="Warpio accessing National Data Platform"
    width="700"
  />
  <p><em>Warpio accessing the National Data Platform to download and analyze the latest EarthScope seismological datasets</em></p>
</center>

The screenshot above demonstrates how researchers can use Warpio to interact with the **National Data Platform (NDP)**, automatically discovering, downloading, and preparing scientific datasets for analysis. In this example, an AI agent accesses EarthScope's seismological data repository, retrieves recent earthquake data (including GeoJSON metadata and CSV seismograph records), and prepares it for computational analysisâ€”all through conversational commands rather than manual data management steps.

IOWarp provides a growing collection of **scientific MCPs** available at [github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps](https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps). Some examples include:

- **Adios MCP**: Analyze and query Adios BP5 files from simulations like LAMMPS, WRF, and more
- **HDF5 MCP**: Explore HDF5 datasets, read metadata, and extract scientific data
- **Jarvis MCP**: Automated application deployment, environment management, and orchestration
- **Slurm MCP**: Job scheduling, resource allocation, and queue management
- **System Monitoring MCPs**: Real-time performance metrics and resource utilization tracking

### Scientific Application Examples

IOWarp supports a wide range of scientific applications through its flexible architecture and scientific MCPs, enabling researchers to interact with complex data using natural language.

#### LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics Simulation

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-around", marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    <img
      src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/atom_1000_trajectory.png").default}
      alt="Atom Trajectory Visualization"
      width="400"
    />
    <p><em>Atom trajectory analysis from LAMMPS simulation</em></p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    <img
      src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/atom_1000_crop.png").default}
      alt="Detailed Atom Analysis"
      width="400"
    />
    <p><em>Detailed single-atom trajectory over time</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

Using IOWarp's Adios MCP, researchers can query simulation outputs with natural language:

> *"Can you write me a python script that plots the trajectory of a single atom over time. The atom of choice should be a parameter to the script. The output should be a PNG image with the results. Please run the script for atom 23."*

The MCP automatically:
1. Reads the Adios BP5 file structure
2. Extracts position data for the specified atom
3. Generates Python visualization code
4. Executes the script and produces the visualization

#### Pipe Flow Data Visualization via ParaView-MCP

    alt="Pipe flow isosurface and orthogonal slices"
    width="700"
  />
  <p><em>3D flow visualization combining isosurface and orthogonal slice planes generated through natural language commands</em></p>
</center>

**Dataset**: Incompact3d pipe flow simulation (data.bp5) with pressure and velocity fields.

**Execution**: Agents used **ParaView-MCP**, a service that connects AI systems to the ParaView visualization engine, to load the dataset and generate the 3D visualization.

**Prompt**: *"Explore the pipe flow data. Generate an isosurface of pressure at pp=0.1 plus three orthogonal slice planes (X, Y, Z)."*

**Result**: Produced a combined 3D flow visualization without manual setup, highlighting internal flow structures. The ParaView-MCP enabled researchers to create complex visualizations through natural language, eliminating the need for manual ParaView configuration, Python scripting, or format conversion. The agent automatically:
- Loaded the BP5 simulation data
- Generated a pressure isosurface at the specified threshold
- Created three orthogonal cutting planes
- Composed the final visualization showing both surface and volumetric flow features

This demonstrates how IOWarp's MCP ecosystem transforms scientific visualization from a multi-step manual process into a conversational workflow, allowing researchers to focus on interpreting results rather than configuring visualization pipelines.

### Performance Results & Benchmarks

We evaluated ContextWarp (IOWarp's agentic framework) across multiple dimensions to understand the performance, correctness, and reliability of AI-driven scientific workflows. Experiments were conducted on Chameleon Cloud using compute nodes with 40GB A100 GPUs.

#### Agentic Workflow Performance: EarthScope Dataset Analysis

**Experiment**: Automated download and visualization of seismological data from the National Data Platform using AI agents.

**Setup**: Claude Code with Sonnet 4 model, with and without IOWarp Context (MCPs and machine configuration).

**Task**: *"Use the ndp mcp to find the latest dataset of the earthscope organization, find the url of the geojson and csv they contain, and download them. The geojson is metadata, the csv contains seismograph data. Plot a figure containing the data of each axis on their own subfigure."*

**Results**:
- **With IOWarp Context**: Successfully completed in **2 minutes** with correct tool selection and visualization
- **Without IOWarp Context**: Failed to execute (agent could not identify correct tools or access methods)
- **Manual Process**: ~**15 minutes** (login, search, download, build visualization script)
- **Speedup**: **7.5x faster** than manual workflow

This demonstrates that IOWarp Context (MCPs + system prompts) is essential for enabling AI agents to interact with scientific infrastructure effectively.

#### Agent Configuration Performance: IOR Deployment

We compared eight agent-model combinations deploying the IOR parallel I/O benchmark across five distinct prompts to assess performance and correctness tradeoffs.

<center>
  <img
    src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/duration_chart_w_OC.png").default}
    alt="Average Deployment Duration by Agent-Model Configuration"
    width="600"
  />
  <p><em>Execution time comparison across different agent and model configurations</em></p>
</center>

**Execution Time Results** (average across 5 prompts):
- **OpenCode + Devstral** (local LLM for execution): **24.8 seconds** (fastest)
- **Cursor + GPT-4o**: **37.7 seconds**
- **Gemini CLI + Gemini 2.5 Pro**: **85.9 seconds**
- **Claude Code + Sonnet 4**: **109.2 seconds**

**Key Finding**: Agents using small, self-hosted LLMs for execution (like Devstral) with large cloud models only for planning achieved competitive or superior performance compared to using large models for all operations. This validates IOWarp's split planning-execution design for efficiency, cost reduction, and data security.

#### Tool Call Success Rates

<center>
  <img
    src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/figure_ior_performance_test.png").default}
    alt="IOR Tool Call Success Rate Comparisons"
    width="700"
  />
  <p><em>Success rates for correctly identifying and invoking scientific tools across agent-model combinations</em></p>
</center>

**Tool Call Success Rates** (5 prompts):
- **Claude Code + Sonnet 4**: ~**100%**
- **Gemini CLI + Gemini 2.5 Pro**: ~**100%**
- **OpenCode + Devstral**: **92.7%**
- **Cursor + GPT-5**: ~**92.8%**
- **Cursor + GPT-4o**: ~**91.8%**
- **OpenCode + Sonic**: ~**91.7%**

While tool success rates varied, all configurations eventually corrected mistakes and achieved correct IOR deployment. Notably, the OpenCode configuration using local Devstral model for execution maintained competitive success rates (92.7%) compared to large cloud-only models.

#### Robustness Across Diverse Prompts

<center>
  <img
    src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/config_success_rates.png").default}
    alt="Robustness Evaluation Across 20 Prompt Variations"
    width="600"
  />
  <p><em>Configuration success rates when tested with 20 different prompt styles ranging from simple to highly detailed</em></p>
</center>

**Robustness Test**: 20 prompts with varying detail levels for IOR deployment, from simple (*"Deploy ior with 8 processes using the deployment agent"*) to detailed bash scripts.

**Configuration Success Rates** (20 prompts):
- **Claude Code + Sonnet 4**: **100%**
- **Gemini CLI + Gemini 2.5 Pro**: **100%**
- **OpenCode CLI + Gemini 2.5 Pro**: **100%**
- **OpenCode CLI + Devstral-2hl**: **100%**
- **Cursor + GPT-5**: Lower success rate (struggled with parameter synonyms like "nprocs" vs "number of processes")

**Key Finding**: IOWarp's agentic design is highly resilient to changes in prompt phrasing and information granularity. Configurations using local LLMs for execution achieved 100% success, demonstrating that the split plan-execution architecture effectively balances cost, security, and reliability.
