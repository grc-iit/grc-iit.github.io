## Architecture

### Modular Architecture

IOWarp's architecture comprises several core components designed to handle various aspects of data flow, integrity, and interoperability.

![IOWarp Architecture](/img/projects/iowarp/architecture.svg)

### Technical Architecture

This section describes the core components of IOWarp's data management platform and their functionality within scientific workflows.

#### Content Assimilation Engine (CAE)

The **Content Assimilation Engine (CAE)** transforms diverse format-specific data into IOWarp's unified data representation format, **Content**, optimized for data transfer. The CAE:

- Integrates with data sources (e.g., Globus, S3, PFS).
- Applies data layout and semantic tagging, preserving context across workflow stages.
- Exports data back to repositories post-processing, ensuring data longevity.

#### Content Transfer Engine (CTE)

The **Content Transfer Engine (CTE)** manages efficient data flow across workflow stages and storage systems.

    alt="Content Transfer Engine with LabIOS"
    width="700"
  />
  <p><em>CTE architecture with LabIOS integration for multi-tiered storage management</em></p>
</center>

Key features include:

- **Multi-tiered I/O**: Supports interactions with advanced storage hardware, including NVMe SSDs and CXL-powered devices.
- **GPU Direct I/O**: Directly transfers data between GPUs for faster model training and inference.
- **Secure Transfer Protocols**: Ensures data security during transfers.

#### Content Exploration Interface (CEI)

The **Content Exploration Interface (CEI)** enables advanced data querying and retrieval, incorporating tools like:

## Towards Agentic-Driven Scientific Workflows

Modern scientific computing is evolving towards **agentic-driven workflows**, where AI agents autonomously orchestrate complex computational tasks, interact with scientific data, and manage HPC resources through natural language interfaces. IOWarp is at the forefront of this transformation, providing the infrastructure and tools necessary to enable intelligent, automated scientific discovery.

Our work on agentic-driven scientific workloads includes the development of **Warpio CLI** and integration with **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)**, enabling researchers to interact with HPC systems, scientific data formats, and computational workflows using natural language and AI-powered assistance.

- **Understand Scientific Data**: Parse and analyze data from formats like HDF5, Adios BP5, NetCDF
- **Orchestrate Workflows**: Submit jobs, manage resources, and coordinate multi-step computational pipelines
- **Generate Insights**: Perform data analysis, create visualizations, and answer scientific queries
- **Ensure Reproducibility**: Track provenance and enable replay of complex workflows

### Scientific Application Examples

IOWarp supports a wide range of scientific applications through its flexible architecture and scientific MCPs, enabling researchers to interact with complex data using natural language.

#### LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics Simulation

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-around", marginTop: "20px" }}>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    <img
      src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/atom_1000_trajectory.png").default}
      alt="Atom Trajectory Visualization"
      width="400"
    />
    <p><em>Atom trajectory analysis from LAMMPS simulation</em></p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    <img
      src={require("@site/static/img/projects/iowarp/atom_1000_crop.png").default}
      alt="Detailed Atom Analysis"
      width="400"
    />
    <p><em>Detailed single-atom trajectory over time</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

Using IOWarp's Adios MCP, researchers can query simulation outputs with natural language:

> *"Can you write me a python script that plots the trajectory of a single atom over time. The atom of choice should be a parameter to the script. The output should be a PNG image with the results. Please run the script for atom 23."*

The MCP automatically:
1. Reads the Adios BP5 file structure
2. Extracts position data for the specified atom
3. Generates Python visualization code
4. Executes the script and produces the visualization
