# Coeus: Accelerating Scientific Insights Using Enriched Metadata

<ProjectBadges projectId="coeus" />

Coeus is a context-aware active storage framework designed to accelerate large-scale scientific data analysis by computing derived quantities in-transit during data production. Implemented as an Adios2 plugin engine and integrated with the Hermes hierarchical buffering platform, Coeus reduces I/O bottlenecks, minimizes unnecessary data movement, and improves time-to-insight for scientific workflows.

In collaboration with Sandia and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Coeus investigates the use of an active storage system to calculate derived quantities and support complex queries on scientific data (simulation and observational) as well as optimizing data placement across the storage hierarchy, with awareness of the resource limitations, to better support the scientific discovery process.

## Project Scope and Vision

### Project Goals

Coeus focuses on:

- **Active in-transit derivation** of scientific quantities to avoid repetitive post-processing I/O
- **Intelligent hierarchical storage** for both raw and derived data to optimize retrieval latency
- **Context-aware data placement** informed by high-level I/O patterns
- **Flexible, SQL-enabled querying** over enriched metadata to accelerate data discovery
- **Transparent integration** with existing Adios2-based workflows

### Vision

Coeus envisions an active storage architecture where scientific insights are computed and stored alongside raw data during simulation, reducing expensive I/O operations and enabling faster, more interactive analysis phases.

## Key Challenges in Scientific Data Analysis

1. **High I/O Cost in Analysis Phase** – Scientific queries often require scanning massive datasets multiple times
2. **Redundant Data Movement** – Raw data is frequently moved and transformed unnecessarily before analysis
3. **Underutilized Storage Hierarchies** – Deep HPC storage tiers are not optimally managed for analysis workloads
4. **Limited Query Capabilities** – Existing HPC I/O libraries lack expressive querying on derived data
5. **Metadata Bottlenecks** – Large-scale metadata operations stress PFS metadata servers
6. **Workflow Separation** – Strict producer/consumer phases increase time-to-insight

---

## Objectives and Architecture Overview

### Core Objectives

- Provide human-readable mathematical language (HDCalc) for defining derived quantities
- Enable efficient extraction of insights from raw and derived data via enriched metadata
- Use context-aware hierarchical storage management for optimal data placement and prefetching
- Avoid slowing simulations by mediating resource contention between production and analysis

### High-Level Architecture

Coeus extends the Adios2 I/O pipeline with:

- **Semantic Derived Quantity Language** → Compiles equations into an Operation Graph (OpGraph) for optimized execution
- **Hierarchical Storage Manager** → Uses Hermes to place and reorganize data blobs based on access patterns
- **Metadata Engine** → Stores operational and enriched metadata in SQLite for fast queries
- **Query API** → Supports range queries, bounding box searches, and derived quantity retrieval

## Technical Architecture

### Semantic Derived Quantity Language

Semantic Derived Quantity Language supports:
- Arithmetic operations, aggregation, filtering, and statistics
- Integrals, derivatives, and mathematical macros
- Equations compiled into OpGraphs with explicit data dependencies

**Example**: Precomputing probability hash functions in the scientific simulation

### Metadata Management

**Operational Metadata** – Automatically tracked variable information (type, dimensions, offsets)

**Enriched Metadata** – User- or system-generated annotations (threshold tags, bounding boxes, statistics)

Stored in SQL database for fast, expressive queries

### Hierarchical Storage Optimization

**Blob Scoring Algorithm** considers:
- Task dependencies
- Access frequency & recency
- Prefetch predictions
- Application-specific priorities

**Context-Aware Prefetching** informed by Adios2 step patterns

**Dynamic Reorganization** to promote/demote data based on changing workflow needs
