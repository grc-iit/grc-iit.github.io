  Luke Logan is a PhD Candidate and HPC software engineer in the Department of Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of
  Technology and a member of the Gnosis Research Center. Luke Logan works under the guidance of Dr.
  Xian-He Sun. His research aims to make distributed storage and operating systems more programmable, portable, and performant. 
  HPC and AI applications perform massive data movements, putting extreme stress on storage systems to satisfy a wide variety of 
  conflicting I/O and computational objectives. However, with rapidly evolving storage hardware and software,
  the design of these systems need to be reconsidered, especially considering the dynamic nature of AI workloads and agents.
