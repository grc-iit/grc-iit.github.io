  Graph processing is a vital component in various application domains.

  However, a good graph processing performance is hard to achieve due to its

  intensive irregular data accesses. Noticing that in real-world graphs, a small

  portion of vertices occupy most connections, several techniques are proposed
  to

  reorder vertices based on their access frequency for better data access
  locality.

  However, these approaches can be further improved by identifying reordered
  data

  more effectively, which will reduce reordering overhead and improve overall

  performance. In this letter, we propose Learning-Based Reordering (LBR), a
  novel

  lightweight framework that identifies and reorders hot data adaptively for
  given

  graphs, algorithms, and threads. Our experimental evaluation indicates that
  LBR

  decreases reordering overhead by 24.7% while improves performance by 9.9%

  compared to the best-performing existing scheme.
