  Cache replacement policy plays an important role in
  guaranteeing the availability of cache blocks, reducing miss
  rates, and improving applications' overall performance.
  However, recent research efforts on improving replacement
  policies require either significant additional hardware or
  major modifications to the organization of the existing cache.
  In this study, we propose the PAC-PLRU cache replacement
  policy. PAC-PLRU not only utilizes but also judiciously
  salvages the prediction information discarded from a
  widely-adopted stride prefetcher. The main idea behind
  PAC-PLRU is utilizing the prediction results generated by the
  existing stride prefetcher and preventing these predicted cache
  blocks from being replaced in the near future. Experimental
  results show that leveraging the PAC-PLRU with a stride
  prefetcher reduces the average L2 cache miss rate by 91% over
  a baseline system with only PLRU policy, and by 22% over a
  system using PLRU with an unconnected stride prefetcher.
  Most importantly, PAC-PLRU only requires minor
  modifications to existing cache architecture to get these
  benefits. The proposed PAC-PLRU policy is promising in
  fostering the connection between prefetching and replacement
  policies, and have a lasting impact on improving the overall
  cache performance.
