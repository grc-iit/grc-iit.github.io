  Concurrent accesses to the shared storage resources
  in current HPC machines lead to severe performance degradation
  caused by I/O contention. In this study, we identify some key
  challenges to efficiently handling interleaved data accesses, and we
  propose a system-wide solution to optimize global performance.
  We implemented and tested several I/O scheduling policies,
  including prioritizing specific applications by leveraging burst
  buffers to defer the conflicting accesses from another application
  and/or directing the requests to different storage servers inside
  the parallel file system infrastructure. The results show that we
  mitigate the negative effects of interference and optimize the
  performance up to 2x depending on the selected I/O policy.
