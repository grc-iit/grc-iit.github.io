abstract: |-
  In this study, the authors propose a simple performance model to
  promote a better integration between the parallel I/O middleware
  layer and parallel file systems. They show that application-
  specific data layout optimization can improve overall data access
  delay considerably for many applications. Implementation results
  under MPI-IO middleware and PVFS2 file system confirm the
  correctness and effectiveness of their approach, and demonstrate
  the potential of data layout optimization in petascale data storage.
