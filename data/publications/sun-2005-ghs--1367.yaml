  Conventional performance evaluation mechanisms
  focus on dedicated distributed systems. Grid computing
  infrastructure, on another hand, is a shared collaborative
  environment constructed
  on
  autonomic
  virtual
  organizations. The non-dedicated characteristic of Grid
  computing prevents the leverage of conventional task
  scheduling systems. In this study, we present the design
  and development of the Grid Harvest Service (GHS)
  performance evaluation and task scheduling system for
  solving large-scale applications in a shared network
  environment. GHS combines stochastic models and
  artificial intelligence learning mechanisms with task
  scheduling algorithms. It considers both computing and
  network contention and supports scheduling for single
  task, parallel processing, and meta-tasks. Experimental
  results show that GHS provides a satisfactory solution for
  performance prediction and task scheduling and has a
  real potential.
