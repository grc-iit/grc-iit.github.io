  Scalability has become an important consideration
  in parallel algorithm and machine designs. The word scalable,
  or scalability, has been widely and often used in the parallel
  processing community. However, there is no adequate, commonly
  accepted definition of scalability available. Scalabilities of com-
  puter systems and programs are difficult to quantify, evaluate,
  and compare. In this paper, scalability is formally defined for
  algorithm-machine combinations. A practical method is proposed
  to provide a quantitative measurement of the scalability. The
  relation between the newly proposed scalability and other existing
  parallel performance metrics is studied. A harmony between
  speedup and scalability has been observed. Theoretical results
  show that a large class of algorithm-machine combinations is
  scalable and the scalability can be predicted through premeasured
  machine parameters. Two algorithms have been studied on an
  nCUBE 2 multicomputer and on a MasPar MP-1 computer.
  These case studies have shown how scalabilities can be measured,
  computed, and predicted. Performance instrumentation and visu-
  alization tools also have been used and developed to understand
  the scalability related behavior.
