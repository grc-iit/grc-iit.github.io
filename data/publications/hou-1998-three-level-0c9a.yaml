  The parallelization of a NASA Navier-Stokes simulation code is carefully and

  systematically investigated. Based on numerical, dependence and partition
  analysis,

  three different levels of parallelization have been proposed and implemented.
  The low-

  level parallelization is at the kernel level. A previously developed parallel
  tridiagonal

  solver is used for concurrent processing. The middle-level parallelization
  solves the

  multiple right-hand-sides of the tridiagonal systems concurrently. The
  high-level

  parallelization is at the level of time step iterations. A PVM implementation
  of the

  parallelization has been accomplished. Different communication patterns and
  different

  PVM communication calls have been examined for best performance. The
  parallelized

  code has been tested on two parallel platforms, a cluster of workstations
  available at

  Louisiana State University and the IBM SP2 parallel computer available at
  Cornell

  Supercomputing Center. Experimental results confirm our analytical findings:
  the three-

  level parallelization is feasible and effective. A linear speedup is measured.
  In addition to

  parallelization, through profiling and performance analysis, the original
  sequential code is

  optimized as well. 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Limited. All rights
