abstract: |-
  The expanding gap between microprocessor and disk
  performance has initiated new techniques of providing
  memory as a service in high-end computing (HEC).
  Although the processor and disk densities have improved
  over the last decades, the improvement of disk
  performance is inferior to that of processors, which is
  causing a bottleneck for HEC. With the rapid growth of
  network technology for cluster computers, the idea of
  accessing memory of an idle peer node has proven to be
  faster than accessing a disk. With this motivation, many
  researchers developed systems that offer idle memory as a
  service. In this paper, we present a brief survey of various
  systems that offer memory service in improving the disk
  access performance and discuss the scope of applying
  service oriented architecture (SOA) for HEC.
