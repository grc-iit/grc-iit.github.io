abstract: |-
  High-end computing (HEC) applications in
  critical areas of science and technology tend to be more
  and more data intensive. I/O has become a vital
  performance bottleneck of modern HEC practice.
  Conventional HEC execution paradigms, however, are
  computing-centric for computation intensive applications.
  They are designed to utilize memory and CPU
  performance and have inherent limitations in addressing
  the critical I/O bottleneck issues of HEC. In this study,
  we propose a decoupled execution paradigm (DEP) to
  address the challenging I/O bottleneck issues. DEP is the
  first paradigm enabling users to identify and handle data-
  intensive operations separately. It can significantly
  reduce costly data movement and is better than the
  existing execution paradigms for data-intensive
  applications. The initial experimental tests have
  confirmed its promising potential. Its data-centric
  architecture could have an impact in future HEC systems,
  programming models, and algorithms design
  development.
