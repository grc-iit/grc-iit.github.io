abstract: |-
  Parallel I/O systems represent the most commonly
  used engineering solution to mitigate the performance mismatch
  between CPU and disk performance; however, parallel I/O sys-
  tems are application dependent and may not work well for certain
  data access requests. New emerging solid state drives (SSD) are
  able to deliver better performance but incur a high monetary
  cost. While SSDs cannot always replace HDDs, the hybrid SSD-
  HDD approach uniquely addresses common performance issues
  in parallel I/O systems. The performance of hybrid SSD-HDD
  architecture depends on the utilization of the SSD and scheduling
  of data placement. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware region-
  level (CARL) data placement scheme for hybrid parallel I/O
  systems. CARL divides large files into several small regions,
  calculates the region costs according to the data access patterns,
  and selectively places regions with high access costs onto the SSD-
  based file servers. We have implemented CARL under MPI-IO
  and the PVFS2 parallel file system environment. Experimental
  results of representative benchmarks show that CARL is both
  feasible and able to improve I/O performance significantly.
