  As the scale of high-performance computing (HPC) continues to grow, failure
  resilience of parallel applications becomes

  crucial. In this paper, we present FT-Pro, an adaptive fault management
  approach that combines proactive migration with reactive

  checkpointing. It aims to enable parallel applications to avoid anticipated
  failures via preventive migration and, in the case of

  unforeseeable failures, to minimize their impact through selective
  checkpointing. An adaptation manager is designed to make runtime

  decisions in response to failure prediction. Extensive experiments, by means
  of stochastic modeling and case studies with real

  applications, indicate that FT-Pro outperforms periodic checkpointing, in
  terms of reducing application completion times and improving

  resource utilization, by up to 43 percent.
