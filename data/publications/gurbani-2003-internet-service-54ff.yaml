abstract: |-
  The intrinsic value of a network is measured by the
  services which it provides to its users. Currently, there are
  two principal networks for communications: the public
  switched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet. As
  these networks converge, new service' ideas become
  apparent that are not possible in isolation on either of the
  networks. This paper discusses how the merging of the
  Internet and the (wireline- and wireless-) PSTN provides
  for an opportunity to transport the state of a PSTN phone
  call to the Internet for service execution. Our approach, as
  embodied in the service architecture, is to leverage the
  best of the Internet protocols (SIP, XML, HTTP) and
  technologies (instant messaging, presence) to provide a
  general framework for personalized service specification
  and execution.
