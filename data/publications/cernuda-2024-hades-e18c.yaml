abstract: |-
  Modern simulation workflows generate and analyze
  massive amounts of data using I/O libraries like Adios2 and
  NetCDF. Although extensive work has optimized the I/O
  processes during the simulation phase, executing analytical
  queries-which often require iterative traversals of large files
  for insights-is cumbersome and usually constrained by low I/O
  performance. Instead of waiting for the analysis phase to process
  queries, quantities can be derived asynchronously during data
  production and cached, speeding up future queries. In this
  work, we introduce a context-aware I/O layer named 'Hades.' It
  is designed to efficiently derive insights from selected quantities
  without compromising overall workflow performance. Hades
  actively and asynchronously computes and stores these quantities
  while the data is in transit. Hades leverages a hierarchical
  buffering system with data access-aware prefetching to ensure
  quick and timely access to relevant data. It offers a flexible
  query interface empowering users to easily define derived
  quantities and provide control over data placement decisions.
  Hades is implemented using an Adios2 plugin engine and the
  Hermes buffering platform, enabling transparent use by any
  Adios-powered application or workflow. Experimental results
  demonstrate performance improvements by up to 3-4x for tested
  real-world scientific producer-consumer workflows.
