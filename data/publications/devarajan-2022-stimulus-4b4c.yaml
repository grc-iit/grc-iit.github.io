  Modern scientific workflows couple simulations with
  AI-powered analytics by frequently exchanging data to accelerate
  time-to-science to reduce the complexity of the simulation planes.
  However, this data exchange is limited in performance and
  portability due to a lack of support for scientific data formats
  in AI frameworks. We need a cohesive mechanism to effectively
  integrate at scale complex scientific data formats such as HDF5,
  PnetCDF, ADIOS2, GNCF, and Silo into popular AI frameworks
  such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Caffe. To this end, we designed
  Stimulus, a data management library for ingesting scientific
  data effectively into the popular AI frameworks. We utilize the
  StimOps functions along with StimPack abstraction to enable the
  integration of scientific data formats with any AI framework. The
  evaluations show that Stimulus outperforms several large-scale
  applications with different use-cases such as Cosmic Tagger (con-
  suming HDF5 dataset in PyTorch), Distributed FFN (consuming
  HDF5 dataset in TensorFlow), and CosmoFlow (converting
  HDF5 into TFRecord and then consuming that in TensorFlow)
  by 5.3x, 2.9x, and 1.9Ã— respectively with ideal I/O scalability up
  to 768 GPUs on the Summit supercomputer. Through Stimulus,
  we can portably extend existing popular AI frameworks to
  cohesively support any complex scientific data format and
  efficiently scale the applications on large-scale supercomputers.
