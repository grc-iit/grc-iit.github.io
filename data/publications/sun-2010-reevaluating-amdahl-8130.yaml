  Microprocessor architecture has entered the multicore era. Recently, Hill and
  Marty presented a

  pessimistic view of multicore scalability. Their analysis was based on
  Amdahl's law (i.e. fixed-workload

  condition) and challenged readers to develop better models. In this study, we
  analyze multicore scalability

  under fixed-time and memory-bound conditions and from the data access (memory
  wall) perspective. We

  use the same hardware cost model of multicore chips used by Hill and Marty,
  but achieve very different

  and more optimistic performance models. These models show that there is no
  inherent, immovable

  upper bound on the scalability of multicore architectures. These results
  complement existing studies and

  demonstrate that multicore architectures are capable of extensive scalability.
