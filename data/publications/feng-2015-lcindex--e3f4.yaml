  A lot of Not Only SQL (NoSQL) databases have
  been proposed in the era of big data. Distributed Ordered
  Table (DOT) is one kind of NoSQL database that has attracted
  lots of attention. It horizontally partitions table into regions
  and distributes regions to region servers according to the
  keys. Multi-Dimensional Range Query (MDRQ) is a common
  operation over DOTs. Many indexing techniques have been
  proposed to improve the performance of MDRQ, but they
  cannot guarantee high performance on both insert and flexible
  MDRQ at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel
  indexing technique named LCIndex, short for Local and
  Clustering Index, to solve this issue. Experimental results
  confirm that LCIndex can achieve high performance on both
  insert operations and flexible MDRQ.
