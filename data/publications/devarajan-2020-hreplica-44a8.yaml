  As the diversity of big data applications increases,
  their requirements diverge and often conflict with one other.
  Managing this diversity in any supercomputer or data center
  is a major challenge for system designers. Data replication is a
  popular approach to meet several of these requirements, such as
  low latency, read availability, durability, etc. This approach can
  be enhanced using new modern heterogeneous hardware and soft-
  ware techniques such as data compression. However, both these
  enhancements work in isolation to the detriment of both. In this
  work, we present HReplica: a dynamic data replication engine
  which harmoniously leverages data compression and hierarchical
  storage to increase the effectiveness of data replication. We have
  developed a novel dynamic selection algorithm that facilitates the
  optimal matching of replication schemes, compression libraries,
  and tiered storage. Our evaluation shows that HReplica can
  improve scientific and cloud application performance by 5.2x
  when compared to other state-of-the-art replication schemes.
  Index Terms-data replication, dynamic, selection algorithm,
  multi-tiered, data compression, intelligent selection, dynamic
  programming, cloud application, scientific application, big data.
