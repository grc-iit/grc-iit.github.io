  In this paper we consider a new caching model that enables data sharing for
  network services in a cost-effective way.

  The proposed caching algorithms are characterized by using monetary cost and
  access information to control the cache replacements,

  instead of exploiting capacity-oriented strategies as in traditional
  approaches. In particular, given a stream of requests to a shared data

  item with respect to a homogeneous cost model, we first propose a fast
  off-line algorithm using dynamic programming techniques,

  which can generate an optimal schedule within O(mn) time-space complexity by
  using cache, migration as well as replication to serve a

  n-length request sequence in a m-node network, substantially improving the
  previous results. Furthermore, we also study the online

  form of this problem, and present an 3-competitive online algorithm by
  leveraging an idea of anticipatory caching. The algorithm can

  serve an online request in constant time and is space efficient in O(m) as
  well, rendering it more practical in reality. We evaluate our

  algorithms, together with some variants, by conducting extensive simulation
  studies. Our results show that the optimal cost of the

  off-line algorithm is changed in a parabolic form as the ratio of caching cost
  to transfer cost is increased, and the online algorithm is less

  than 2 times worse in most cases than its optimal off-line counterpart.
