  In this paper, we propose C2-Bound, a data-driven
  analytical model, that incorporates both memory capacity and
  data access concurrency factors to optimize many-core design.
  C2-Bound is characterized by combining the newly proposed
  latency model, concurrent average memory access time (C-
  AMAT), with the well-known memory-bounded speedup model
  (Sun-Ni's law) to facilitate computing tasks. Compared to tradi-
  tional chip designs that lack the notion of memory concurrency
  and memory capacity, C2-Bound model finds memory bound
  factors significantly impact the optimal number of cores as
  well as their optimal silicon area allocations, especially for
  data-intensive applications with a none parallelizable sequential
  portion. Therefore, our model is valuable to the design of new
  generation many-core architectures that target big data process-
  ing, where working sets are usually larger than conventional
  scientific computing. These findings are evidenced by our detailed
  simulations, which show with C2-Bound the design space can be
  narrowed down significantly up to four orders of magnitude.
  C2-Bound analytic results can be either used in reconfigurable
  hardware environments or, by software designers, applied to
  scheduling, partitioning, and allocating resources among diverse
  applications.
