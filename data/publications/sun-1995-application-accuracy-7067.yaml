  The Parallel Diagonal Dominant (PDD) algorithm is an efficient tridiagonal
  solver. In

  this paper, a detailed study of the PDD algorithm is given. First the PDD
  algorithm is

  extended to solve periodic tridiagonal systems and its scalability is studied.
  Then the

  reduced PDD algorithm, which has a smaller operation count than that of the
  conventional

  sequential algorithm for many applications, is proposed. Accuracy analysis is
  provided for a

  class of tridiagonal systems, the symmetric and skew-symmetric Toeplitz
  tridiagonal systems.

  Implementation results show that the analysis gives a good bound on the
  relative error, and

  the PDD and reduced PDD algorithms are good candidates for emerging massively
  parallel

  machines.
