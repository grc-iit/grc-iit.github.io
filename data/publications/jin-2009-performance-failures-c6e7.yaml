  As the scale and complexity of parallel systems
  continue to grow, failures become more and more an inevitable
  fact for solving large-scale applications. In this research, we
  present an analytical study to estimate execution time in the
  presence of failures of directed acyclic graph (DAG) based
  Scientific Applications and provide a guideline for performance
  optimization. The study is four fold. We first introduce a
  performance model to predict individual subtask computation
  time under failures. Next, a layered, iterative approach is
  adopted to transform a DAG into a layered DAG, which reflects
  full dependencies among all the subtasks. Then, the expected
  execution time under failures of the DAG is derived based on
  stochastic analysis. Unlike existing models, this newly proposed
  performance model provides both the variance and distribution.
  It is practical and can be put to real use. Finally, based on the
  model, performance optimization, weak point identification and
  enhancement are proposed. Intensive simulations are conducted
  to verify the analytical findings. They show that the newly
  proposed model and weak point enhancement mechanism work
  well.
