abstract: |-
  Due to the infamous "memory wall" problem and a drastic
  increase in the number of data intensive applications, memory
  rather than processor has become the leading performance
  bottleneck of modern computing systems. Evaluating and
  understanding memory system performance is increasingly
  becoming the core of high-end computing. Conventional memory
  metrics, such as miss ratio, average miss latency, average memory
  access time, etc., are designed to measure a given memory
  performance parameter, and do not reflect the overall performance
  of a memory system. On the other hand, widely used system
  measurement metrics, such as IPC and Flops are designed to
  measure CPU performance, and do not directly reflect memory
  performance. In this paper, we proposed a novel memory metric,
  Access Per Cycle (APC), to measure overall memory performance
  with consideration of the complexity of modern memory systems.
  A unique contribution of APC is its separation of memory
  evaluation from CPU evaluation; therefore, it provides a
  quantitative measurement of the "data-intensiveness" of an
  application. The concept of APC is introduced; a constructive
  investigation counting the number of data accesses and access
  cycles at differing levels of the memory hierarchy is conducted;
  finally some important usages of APC are presented. Simulation
  results show that APC is significantly more appropriate than
  existing memory metrics in evaluating modern memory systems.
