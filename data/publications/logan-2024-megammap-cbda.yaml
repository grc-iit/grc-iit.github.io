abstract: |-
  Large-scale data analytics, scientific simulation, and
  deep learning codes in HPC perform massive computations on data
  greatly exceeding the bounds of main memory. These out-of-core al-
  gorithms suffer from severe data movement penalties, programming
  complexity, and limited code reuse. To solve this, HPC sites have
  steadily increased DRAM capacity. However, this is not sustainable
  due to financial and environmental costs. A more elegant, low-cost,
  and portable solution is to expand memory to distributed multi-
  tiered storage. In this work, we propose MegaMmap: a software
  distributed shared memory (DSM) that enlarges effective memory
  capacity through intelligent tiered DRAM and storage management.
  MegaMmap provides workload-aware data organization, eviction,
  and prefetching policies to reduce DRAM consumption while ensur-
  ing speedy access to critical data. A variety of memory coherence
  optimizations are provided through an intuitive hinting system.
  Evaluations show that various workloads can be executed with a
  fraction of the DRAM while offering competitive performance.
