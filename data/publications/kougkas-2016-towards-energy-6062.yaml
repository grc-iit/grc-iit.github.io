abstract: |-
  An Open Ethernet Drive (OED) is a new technology
  that encloses into a hard drive (HDD or SSD) a low-power
  processor, a fixed-size memory and an Ethernet card. In this study,
  we thoroughly evaluate the performance of such device and the
  energy requirements to operate it. The results show that first it
  is a viable solution to offload data-intensive computations on the
  OED while maintaining a reasonable performance, and second,
  the energy consumption savings from utilizing such technology
  are significant as it only consumes 10% of the power needed by
  a normal server node. We propose that by using OED devices as
  storage servers in HPC, we can run a reliable, scalable, cost and
  energy efficient storage solution.
