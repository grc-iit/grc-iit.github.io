  Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is considered a
  promising solution to improve the performance of graph-
  computing applications by minimizing the data movement be-
  tween the host and memory. Which workload to offload and how
  to offload it to PIM logic determine whether the PIM architecture
  is well utilized. Offloading too much or too little workload
  from the host processor to the PIM side could hurt overall
  performance. On the other hand, the offloading granularity
  needs to be representative without losing generality. In this
  paper, we present CoPIM, a novel PIM workload offloading
  architecture that can dynamically determine which portion of the
  graph workload can benefit more from PIM-side computation.
  COPIM focuses on the loop code blocks of graph applications
  and evaluates the necessity of offloading based on a concurrent
  memory access model. We also provide detailed architectural
  designs to support the offloading. In this way, CoPIM reduces
  the size of offloading instructions and also improves the overall
  performance with less energy consumption. The experimental
  results show that compared with other state-of-the-art PIM
  workload offloading frameworks, CoPIM achieves a speedup
  by the geometric mean of 19.5% and 11.4% than PEI and
  GraphPIM, respectively. On the other hand, CoPIM also reduces
  the un-core energy consumption by 6.8% and 6.5% on average
  over PEI and GraphPIM, respectively.
