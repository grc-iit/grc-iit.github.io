abstract: |-
  The next-generation network is characterized
  by the merging of the Internet, telecommunica-
  tions, and information technology. As envisioned
  some six years ago, the NGN was to revolutionize
  the lives of its users by providing them the best of
  the services of the PSTN and the Internet, written
  rapidly by IT programmers. Service providers were
  to be similarly affected by the increase in revenues
  paid by the users of these new services. Equip-
  ment vendors would have a difficult time keeping
  inventories of the NGN infrastructure. The truth
  has been somewhat different. In this article we
  characterize a set of inhibitors - technical, regu-
  latory, and business-related
  that are affecting
  the ubiquitous deployment of NGN services.
