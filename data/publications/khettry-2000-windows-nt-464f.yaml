  Virtual Collaborative Environment (VCE) addresses enabling technologies to
  support collaborative, distributed, computer-based problem

  solving for engineering applications. The goal is to simulate a virtual
  laboratory, based on cooperative computing substrate, that integrally

  supports a shared workspace, high performance computing, distributed data
  management, as well as graphical scientific communication. In

  this study we present the design and development of a Windows-NT based VCE for
  technical computing. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All
