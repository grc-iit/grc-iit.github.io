abstract: |-
  Due to the infamous "memory wall" problem and a drastic
  increase in the number of data intensive applications, memory
  rather than processor has become the leading performance
  bottleneck of modern computing systems. Evaluating and
  understanding memory system performance is increasingly
  becoming the core of high-end computing. Conventional memory
  metrics, such as miss ratio, average miss latency, average memory
  access time, etc., are designed to measure a given memory
  performance parameter, and do not reflect the overall performance
  of a memory system. On the other hand, widely used system
  performance metrics, such as IPC and Flops are designed to
  measure CPU performance, and are not appropriate for memory
  performance. In this study, we propose a novel memory metric,
  Access Per Cycle (APC), to measure overall memory performance
  with consideration of the complexity of modern memory systems.
  A unique contribution of APC is its separation of memory
  evaluation from CPU evaluation. Simulation results show that
  APC is significantly more appropriate than existing memory
  metrics in evaluating modern memory systems.
