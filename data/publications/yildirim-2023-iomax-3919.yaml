abstract: |-
  I/O analysis is an essential task for improving the performance
  of scientific applications on high-performance computing (HPC)
  systems. However, current analysis tools, which often use data
  drilling techniques (iterative exploration for deeper insights), treat
  every query independently and do not optimize column data for
  data-slicing (extracting specific data subsets), resulting in subpar
  querying performance. In this paper, we designed IOMax, a tool
  for efficient data drilling analysis on large-scale I/O traces. IOMax
  utilizes a novel query optimization technique to improve the query
  performance by 8.6x while reducing the memory footprint required
  for analysis by 11x. Additionally, it employs data transformation
  techniques to improve data-slicing performance by up to 11.4x. In
  conclusion, IOMax optimizes I/O analysis for scientific workflows
  on the Lassen supercomputer, resulting in up to 7x improvement.
