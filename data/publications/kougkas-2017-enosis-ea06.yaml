  File and block storage are well-defined concepts
  in computing and have been used as common components of
  computer systems for decades. Big data has led to new types
  of storage. The predominant data model in cloud storage is the
  object-based storage and it is highly successful. Object stores
  follow a simpler API with get() and put() operations to interact
  with the data. A wide variety of data analysis software have
  been developed around objects using their APIs. However, object
  storage and traditional file storage are designed for different
  purpose and for different applications. Organizations maintain
  file-based storage clusters and a high volume of existing data are
  stored in files. Moreover, many new applications need to access
  data from both types of storage. In this paper, we first explore
  the key differences between object-based and the more traditional
  file-based storage systems. We have designed and implemented
  several file-to-object mapping algorithms to bridge the semantic
  gap between these data models. Our evaluation shows that by
  achieving an efficient such mapping, our library can grant 2x-
  27x higher performance against a naive one-to-one mapping and
  with minimal overheads. Our study exposes various strengths and
  weaknesses of each mapping strategy and frames the extended
  potential of a unified data access system.
