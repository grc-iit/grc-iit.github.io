  Modern memory systems are structured under hierarchy and concurrency. The
  combined impact of hierarchy

  and concurrency, however, is application dependent and difficult to describe.
  In this article, we introduce

  C2-Bound, a data-driven analytical model that serves the purpose of optimizing
  many-core design. C2-Bound

  considers both memory capacity and data access concurrency. It utilizes the
  combined power of the newly

  proposed latency model, concurrent average memory access time, and the
  well-known memory-bounded

  speedup model (Sun-Ni's law) to facilitate computing tasks. Compared to
  traditional chip designs that lack

  the notion of memory capacity and concurrency, the C2-Bound model finds that
  memory bound factors

  significantly impact the optimal number of cores as well as their optimal
  silicon area allocations, especially

  for data-intensive applications with a non-parallelizable sequential portion.
  Therefore, our model is valuable

  to the design of next-generation many-core architectures that target big data
  processing, where working sets

  are usually larger than the conventional scientific computing. These findings
  are evidenced by our detailed

  simulations, which show, with C2-Bound, the design space of chip design can be
  narrowed down significantly

  up to four orders of magnitude. C2-Bound analytic results can be either used
  in reconfigurable hardware

  environments or, by software designers, applied to scheduling, partitioning,
  and allocating resources among

  diverse applications.
