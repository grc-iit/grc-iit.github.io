abstract: |-
  The ever-increasing volume of data produced by
  HPC simulations necessitates scalable methods for data explo-
  ration and knowledge extraction. Scientific data analysis often in-
  volves complex queries across distributed datasets, requiring ma-
  nipulation of multiple primary variables and generating derived
  data that needs to be handled efficiently, creating challenges for
  applications that need to parse many large datasets. Relying on
  individual applications to handle all intermediate data generally
  leads to redundant computations across studies and unnecessary
  data transfers. In this paper, we investigate the performance of
  different approaches where applications define derived variables
  as quantities of interest (QoIs) and offload the computation and
  transfer of these QoIs to the I/O library. This significantly reduces
  redundancy and optimizes data movement across the distributed
  storage and processing infrastructure by allowing control over
  when and where derived variables are computed. We present a
  detailed analysis of the performance-storage trade-offs associated
  with different solutions and showcase results for our study on
  two large-scale datasets created from climate and combustion
  simulations.
