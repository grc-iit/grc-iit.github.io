  This study presents a practical solution for data collection and restoration
  to migrate a process written

  in high-level stack-based languages such as C and Fortran over a network of
  heterogeneous computers.

  We first introduce a logical data model, namely the Memory Space
  Representation (MSR) model,

  to recognize complex data structures in process address space. Then, novel
  methods are developed to

  incorporate the MSR model into a process, and to collect and restore data
  efficiently. We have implemented

  prototype software and performed experiments on different programs.
  Experimental and analytical results

  show that: (1) a user-level process can be migrated across different computing
  platforms; (2) semantic

  information of data structures in the process's memory space can be correctly
  collected and restored;

  (3) costs of data collection and restoration depend on the complexity of the
  MSR graph in the memory

  space and the amount of data involved; and (4) the implantation of the MSR
  model into the process is not

  a decisive factor of incurring execution overheads. With appropriate program
  analysis, we can practically

  achieve low overhead.
