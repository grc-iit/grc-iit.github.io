  Checkpointing is the predominant storage driver in
  today's petascale supercomputers and is expected to remain as
  such in tomorrow's exascale supercomputers. Users typically pre-
  fer to checkpoint into a shared file yet parallel file systems often
  perform poorly for shared file writing. A powerful technique to
  address this problem is to transparently transform shared file
  writing into many exclusively written as is done in ADIOS and
  PLFS. Unfortunately, the metadata to reconstruct the fragments
  into the original file grows with the number of writers. As such,
  the current approach cannot scale to exaflop supercomputers due
  to the large overhead of creating and reassembling the metadata.
  In this paper, we develop and evaluate algorithms by which
  patterns in the PLFS metadata can be discovered and then
  used to replace the current metadata. Our evaluation shows that
  these patterns reduce the size of the metadata by several orders
  of magnitude, increase the performance of writes by up to 40
  percent, and the performance of reads by up to 480 percent. This
  contribution therefore can allow current checkpointing models to
  survive the transition from peta- to exascale.
