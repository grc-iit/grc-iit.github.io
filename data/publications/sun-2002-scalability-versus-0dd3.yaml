  Parallel programming is elusive. The relative performance of different

  parallel implementations varies with machine architecture, system and

  problem size. How to compare different implementations over a wide range

  of machine architectures and problem sizes has not been well addressed due

  to its difficulty. Scalability has been proposed in recent years to reveal
  scaling

  properties of parallel algorithms and machines. In this paper, the relation

  between scalability and execution time is carefully studied. The concepts of

  crossing point analysis and range comparison are introduced. Crossing point

  analysis finds slow/fast performance crossing points of parallel algorithms

  and machines. Range comparison compares performance over a wide range

  of ensemble and problem size via scalability and crossing point analysis.

  Three algorithms from scientific computing are implemented on an Intel

  Paragon and an IBM SP2 parallel computer. Experimental and theoretical

  results show how the combination of scalability, crossing point analysis, and

  range comparison provides a practical solution for scalable performance

  evaluation and prediction. While our testings are conducted on homogeneous

  parallel computers, the proposed methodology applies to heterogeneous and

  network computing as well. Â©2002 Elsevier Science (USA)
