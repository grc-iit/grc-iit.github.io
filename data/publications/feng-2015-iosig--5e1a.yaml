  Hadoop, as one of the most widely accepted MapReduce frameworks, is naturally
  data-intensive. Its several dependent projects, such as Mahout and Hive,
  inherent this characteristic. Meanwhile I/O optimization becomes a daunting
  work, since applications' source code is not always available. I/O traces for
  Hadoop and its dependents are increasingly important, because it can
  faithfully reveal intrinsic I/O behaviors without knowing the source code.
  This method can not only help to diagnose system bottlenecks but also further
  optimize performance. To achieve this goal, we propose a transparent tracing
  and analysis tool suite, namely IOSIG+, which can be plugged into Hadoop
  system. We make several contributions: 1) we describe our approach of tracing;
  2) we release the tracer, which can trace I/O operations without modifying
  targets' source code; 3) this work adopts several techniques to mitigate the
  introduced execution overhead at runtime; 4) we create an analyzer, which
  helps to discover new approaches to address I/O problems according to access
  patterns. The experimental results and analysis confirm its effectiveness and
  the observed overhead can be as low as 1.97%.
