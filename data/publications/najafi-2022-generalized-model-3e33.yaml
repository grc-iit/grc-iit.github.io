  Memory system is critical to architecture design which can significantly
  impact application performance.

  Concurrent Average Memory Access Time (C-AMAT) is a model for analyzing and
  optimizing memory

  system performance using a recursive definition of the memory access latency
  along the memory hierarchy.

  The original C-AMAT model, however, does not provide the necessary granularity
  and flexibility for handling

  modern memory architectures with heterogeneous memory technologies and diverse
  system topology. We

  propose to augment C-AMAT to take into consideration the idiosyncrasies of
  individual cache/memory

  components as well as their topological arrangement in the memory architecture
  design. Through trace-

  based simulation, we validate the augmented model and examine the memory
  system performance with

  insight unavailable using the original C-AMAT model.
