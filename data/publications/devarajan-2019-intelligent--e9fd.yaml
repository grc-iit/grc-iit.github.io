abstract: |-
  The data explosion phenomenon in modern appli-
  cations causes tremendous stress on storage systems. Developers
  use data compression, a size-reduction technique, to address
  this issue. However, each compression library exhibits different
  strengths and weaknesses when considering the input data type
  and format. We present Ares, an intelligent, adaptive, and
  flexible compression framework which can dynamically choose a
  compression library for a given input data based on the type of
  the workload and provides an appropriate infrastructure to users
  to fine-tune the chosen library. Ares is a modular framework
  which unifies several compression libraries while allowing the
  addition of more compression libraries by the user. Ares is a
  unified compression engine that abstracts the complexity of using
  different compression libraries for each workload. Evaluation
  results show that under real-world applications, from both
  scientific and Cloud domains, Ares performed 2-6x faster than
  competitive solutions with a low cost of additional data analysis
  (i.e., overheads around 10%) and up to 10x faster against a
  baseline of no compression at all.
