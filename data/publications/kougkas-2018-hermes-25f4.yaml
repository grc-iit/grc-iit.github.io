  Modern High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems are adding
  extra layers to the memory and storage hierarchy, named deep
  memory and storage hierarchy (DMSH), to increase I/O perfor-
  mance. New hardware technologies, such as NVMe and SSD, have
  been introduced in burst buffer installations to reduce the pressure
  for external storage and boost the burstiness of modern I/O systems.
  The DMSH has demonstrated its strength and potential in practice.
  However, each layer of DMSH is an independent heterogeneous
  system and data movement among more layers is significantly
  more complex even without considering heterogeneity. How to
  efficiently utilize the DMSH is a subject of research facing the HPC
  community. In this paper, we present the design and implementa-
  tion of Hermes: a new, heterogeneous-aware, multi-tiered, dynamic,
  and distributed I/O buffering system. Hermes enables, manages, su-
  pervises, and, in some sense, extends I/O buffering to fully integrate
  into the DMSH. We introduce three novel data placement policies
  to efficiently utilize all layers and we present three novel techniques
  to perform memory, metadata, and communication management
  in hierarchical buffering systems. Our evaluation shows that, in ad-
  dition to automatic data movement through the hierarchy, Hermes
  can significantly accelerate I/O and outperforms by more than 2x
  state-of-the-art buffering platforms.
