abstract: |-
  Parallel file systems (PFS) are widely-used in mod-
  ern computing systems to mask the ever-increasing performance
  gap between computing and data access. PFSs favor large
  requests, and do not work well for small requests, especially
  small random requests. Newer Solid State Drives (SSD) have
  excellent performance on small random data accesses, but also
  incur a high monetary cost. In this study, we propose a hybrid
  architecture named the Smart Selective SSD Cache (S4D-Cache),
  which employs a small set of SSD-based file servers as a selective
  cache of conventional HDD-based file servers. A novel scheme
  is introduced to identify performance-critical data, and conduct
  selective cache admission to fully utilize the hybrid architecture
  in terms of data-access parallelism and randomness. We have
  implemented an S4D-Cache under the MPI-IO and PVFS2
  parallel file system. Our experiments show that S4D-Cache
  can significantly improve I/O throughput, and is a promising
  approach for parallel applications.
