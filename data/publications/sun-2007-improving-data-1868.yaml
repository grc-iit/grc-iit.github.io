abstract: |-
  Data prefetching, where data is fetched before CPU
  demands for it, has been considered as an effective
  solution to mask data access latency. However, the
  current client-initiated prefetching strategies do not work
  well for applications with complex, non-contiguous data
  access patterns. While technology advances continue to
  enlarge the gap between computing and data access
  performance, trading computing power for data access
  delay has become a natural choice. We propose a server-
  based data-push approach. In this server-push
  architecture, a dedicated server named Data Push Server
  (DPS) initiates and proactively pushes data closer to the
  client in time. We present the DPS architecture and study
  the issues such as what data to fetch, when to fetch, how
  to push, and data access modeling.
