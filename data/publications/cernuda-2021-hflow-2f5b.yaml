  Modern applications are highly data-intensive, leading
  to the well-known I/O bottleneck problem. Scientists have proposed
  the placement of fast intermediate storage resources which aim
  to mask the I/O penalties. To manage these resources, three core
  software abstractions are being used in leadership-class computing
  facilities: IO Forwarders, Burst Buffers, and Data Stagers. Yet, with
  the rise of multi-tenant deployment in HPC systems, these software
  abstractions are: managed and maintained in isolation, leading to
  inefficient interactions; allocated statically, leading to load imbalance;
  exclusively bifurcated between the intermediate storage, leading to
  under-utilization of resources, and, in many cases, do not support
  in-situ operations. To this end, we present HFlow, a new class of
  data forwarding system that leverages a real-time data movement
  paradigm. HFlow introduces a unified data movement abstraction
  (the ByteFlow) providing data-independent tasks that can be
  executed anywhere and thus, enabling dynamic resource provisioning.
  Moreover, the processing elements executing the ByteFlows are
  designed to be ephemeral and, hence, enable elastic management of
  intermediate storage resources. Our results show that applications
  running under HFlow display an increase in performance of 3x when
  compared with state-of-the-art software solutions.
