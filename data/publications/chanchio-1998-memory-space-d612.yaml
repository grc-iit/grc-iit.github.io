  A major difficulty of heterogeneous process migration
  is how to collect advanced dynamic data-structures, trans-
  form them into machine independent form, and restor them
  appropriately in a different hardware and software environ-
  ment. In this study we introduce a data model, the Mem-
  ory Space Representation (MSR) model, to recognize com-
  plex data structures in program address spaces. Support-
  ing mechanisms of the MSR model are also developed for
  collecting program data structures and restoring them in a
  heterogeneous environment. The MSR design has been im-
  plemented under a prototype heterogeneous process migra-
  tion environment. Pointer-intensive programs with function
  and recursion calls are tested. Experimental results confirm
  that the newly proposed design is feasible and effective for
  heterogeneous network process migration.
