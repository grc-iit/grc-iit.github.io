  As applications become increasingly data intensive, conventional computing
  systems become increasingly inefficient due to

  data access performance bottlenecks. While intensive efforts have been made in
  developing new memory technologies and in

  designing special purpose machines, there is a lack of solutions for
  evaluating and utilizing recent hardware advancements to address

  the memory-wall problem in a systematic way. In this study, we present the
  memory Layered Performance Matching (LPM)

  methodology to provide a systematic approach for data access performance
  optimization. LPM uniquely presents and utilizes the data

  access concurrency, in addition to data access locality, in a memory
  hierarchical system. The LPM methodology consists of models

  and algorithms, and is supported with a series of analytic results for its
  correctness. The rationale of LPM is to reduce the overall data

  access delay through the matching of data request rate and data supply rate at
  each layer of a memory hierarchy, with a balanced

  consideration of data locality, data concurrency, and latency hiding of data
  flow. Extensive experimentations on both physical platforms

  and software simulators confirm our theoretical findings, and they show that
  the LPM approach can be applied in diverse computing

  platforms and can effectively guide performance optimization of memory
  systems.
