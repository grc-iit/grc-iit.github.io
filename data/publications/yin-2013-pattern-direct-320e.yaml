abstract: |-
  The performance gap between computing power
  and the I/O system is ever increasing, and in the meantime
  more and more High Performance Computing (HPC) ap-
  plications are becoming data intensive. This study describes
  an I/O data replication scheme, named Pattern-Direct and
  Layout-Aware (PDLA) data replication scheme, to alleviate
  this performance gap. The basic idea of PDLA is replicating
  identified data access pattern, and saving these reorganized
  replications with optimized data layouts based on access cost
  analysis. A runtime system is designed and developed to
  integrate the PDLA replication scheme and existing parallel
  I/O system; a prototype of PDLA is implemented under the
  MPICH2 and PVFS2 environments. Experimental results show
  that PDLA is effective in improving data access performance
  of parallel I/O systems.
