abstract: |-
  A new method, namely the Parallel Two-Level Hybrid
  (PTH) method, is developed to solve tridiagonal systems
  on parallel computers. PTH is designed based on Parallel
  Diagonal Dominant (PDD) algorithm. Like PDD, PTH is
  highly scalable. It provides accurate solutions when PDD
  may not be applicable and maintains a near PDD
  performance when the underlying machine ensemble size
  is large. By controlling its two-level partition, PTH can
  deliver optimal performance for different machine
  ensemble and problem sizes. Theoretical analyses and
  numerical experiments indicate that PTH is significantly
  better than existing methods for many scientific and
  engineering applications.
