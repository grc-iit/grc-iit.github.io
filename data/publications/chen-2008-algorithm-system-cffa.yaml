  Scalability is a key factor of the design of distributed systems and parallel
  algorithms and machines.

  However, conventional scalabilities are designed for homogeneous parallel
  processing. There is no

  suitable and commonly accepted definition of scalability metric for
  heterogeneous systems. Isospeed

  scalability is a well-defined metric for homogeneous computing. This study
  extends the isospeed

  scalability metric to general heterogeneous computing systems. The proposed
  isospeed-efficiency model

  is suitable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous computing. Through
  theoretical analyses, we derive

  methodologies of scalability measurement and prediction for heterogeneous
  systems. Experimental

  results have verified the analytical results and confirmed that the proposed
  isospeed-efficiency scalability

  works well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.
