  The rapid advance of processor architectures such as the emerged multicore
  architectures

  and the substantially increased computing capability on chip have put more
  pressure on

  the sluggish memory systems than ever. In the meantime, many applications
  become more

  and more data intensive. Data-access delay, not the processor speed, becomes
  the leading

  performance bottleneck of high-performance computing. Data prefetching is an
  effective

  solution to accelerating applications' data access and bridging the growing
  gap between

  computing speed and data-access speed. Existing works of prefetching, however,
  are very

  conservative in general, due to the computing power consumption concern of the
  past.

  They suffer low effectiveness especially when applications' access pattern
  changes. In this

  study, we propose an Algorithm-level Feedback-controlled Adaptive (AFA) data
  prefetcher

  to address these issues. The AFA prefetcher is based on the Data-Access
  History Cache, a

  hardware structure that is specifically designed for data access acceleration.
  It provides

  an algorithm-level adaptation and is capable of dynamically adapting to
  appropriate pre-

  fetching algorithms at runtime. We have conducted extensive simulation testing
  with

  the SimpleScalar simulator to validate the design and to analyze the
  performance gain.

  The simulation results show that the AFA prefetcher is effective and achieves
  considerable

  IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) improvement for 21 representative SPEC-CPU
  benchmarks.
