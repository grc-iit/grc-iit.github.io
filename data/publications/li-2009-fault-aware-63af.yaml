  As the scale of parallel systems continues to grow, fault management of these
  systems is becoming a critical challenge.

  While existing research mainly focuses on developing or improving fault
  tolerance techniques, a number of key issues remain open. In

  this paper, we propose runtime strategies for spare node allocation and job
  rescheduling in response to failure prediction. These

  strategies, together with failure prediction and fault tolerance techniques,
  construct a runtime system called Fault-Aware Runtime

  System (FARS). In particular, we propose a 0-1 knapsack model and demonstrate
  its flexibility and effectiveness for reallocating running

  jobs to avoid failures. Experiments, by means of synthetic data and real
  traces from production systems, show that FARS has the

  potential to significantly improve system productivity (i.e., performance and
  reliability).
