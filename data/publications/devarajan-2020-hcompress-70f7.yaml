  Modern scientific applications read and write
  massive amounts of data through simulations, observations, and
  analysis. These applications spend the majority of their runtime
  in performing I/O. HPC storage solutions include fast node-local
  and shared storage resources to elevate applications from this
  bottleneck. Moreover, several middleware libraries (e.g., Hermes)
  are proposed to move data between these tiers transparently.
  Data reduction is another technique that reduces the amount of
  data produced and, hence, improve I/O performance. These two
  technologies, if used together, can benefit from each other. The
  effectiveness of data compression can be enhanced by selecting
  different compression algorithms according to the characteristics
  of the different tiers, and the multi-tiered hierarchy can benefit
  from extra capacity. In this paper, we design and implement
  HCompress, a hierarchical data compression library that
  can improve the application's performance by harmoniously
  leveraging both multi-tiered storage and data compression.
  We have developed a novel compression selection algorithm
  that facilitates the optimal matching of compression libraries
  to the tiered storage. Our evaluation shows that HCompress
  can improve scientific application's performance by 7x when
  compared to other state-of-the-art tiered storage solutions.
