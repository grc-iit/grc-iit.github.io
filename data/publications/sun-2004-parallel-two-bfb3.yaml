  A new method, namely, the Parallel Two-Level Hybrid (PTH) method, is developed
  to solve tridiagonal systems on parallel

  computers. PTH has two levels of parallelism. The first level is based on
  algorithms developed from the Sherman-Morrison

  modification formula, and the second level can choose different parallel
  tridiagonal solvers for different applications. By choosing

  different outer and inner solvers and by controlling its two-level partition,
  PTH can deliver better performance for different applications

  on different machine ensembles and problem sizes. In an extreme case, the two
  levels of parallelism can be merged into one, and PTH

  can be the best algorithm otherwise available. Theoretical analyses and
  numerical experiments indicate that PTH is significantly better

  than existing methods on massively parallel computers. For instance, using PTH
  in a fast Poisson solver results in a 2-folds speedup

  compared to a conventional parallel Poisson solver on a 512 nodes IBM machine.
  When only the tridiagonal solver is considered, PTH

  is over 10 times faster than the currently used implementation.
