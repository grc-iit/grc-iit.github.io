  In 2006, Jeannette M. Wing proposed the concept of “computational thinking,”
  which has produced significant worldwide impacts on the education, research,
  and development of computer science. After more than a decade, we reexamine
  computational thinking, and find that a more general-thinking paradigm is
  urgently needed to address new challenges. More generally, we identify four
  foundational thinking patterns that will foster computer system innovations:
  historical thinking, computational thinking, data-centric thinking, and
  architectural thinking (HDCA). The combination of these four patterns forms a
  regular tetrahedron thinking paradigm, providing a unified framework for
  computer design innovations. This thinking paradigm will provide a reference
  model for researchers and practitioners to guide and boost the next wave of
  innovations in computer systems.
