  The MapReduce programming paradigm is
  gaining more and more popularity recently due to its merits
  of ease of programming, data distribution and fault tolerance.
  The low barrier of adoption of MapReduce makes it a
  promising framework for non-dedicated distributed
  computing environments. However, the variability of hosts
  resources and availability could substantially degrade the
  performance of MapReduce applications. The replication-
  based fault tolerance mechanism helps to alleviate some
  problems at the cost of inefficient storage space utilization.
  Intelligent solutions that guarantee the performance of
  MapReduce applications with low data replication degree are
  needed to promote the idea of running MapReduce
  applications in non-dedicated environment at lower costs. In
  this research, we propose an Availability-aware DAta
  PlacemenT (ADAPT) strategy to improve the application
  performance without extra storage cost. The basic idea of
  ADAPT is to dispatch data based on the availability of each
  node, reduce network traffic, improve data locality, and
  optimize the application performance. We implement the
  prototype of ADAPT within the Hadoop framework, an open-
  source implementation of MapReduce. The performance of
  ADAPT is evaluated in
  emulated non-dedicated
  distributed environment. The experimental results show that
  ADAPT can improve the performance by more than 30%.
  ADAPT achieves high reliability without the need for
  additional data replication. ADAPT has also been evaluated
  for large-scale computing environment through simulations,
  with promising results.
