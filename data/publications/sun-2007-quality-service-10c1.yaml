  Rapid advancement of communication technology
  has changed the landscape of computing. New models
  of computing, such as business-on-demand, Web
  services, peer-to-peer networks, and Grid computing
  have emerged to harness distributed computing and
  network resources to provide powerful services. The
  non-deterministic characteristic of the resource
  availability in these new computing platforms raises an
  outstanding challenge: how to support Quality of
  Service (QoS) to meet a user's demand? In this study,
  we conduct a thorough study of QoS of distributed
  computing, especially on Grid computing where the
  requirement of distributed sharing and coordination
  goes to the extreme. We start at QoS policies, and then
  focus on technical issues of the enforcement of the
  policies and performance optimization under each
  policy. This study provides a classification of existing
  software system based on their underlying policies, a
  systematic understanding of QoS, and a framework for
  QoS of Grid computing.
