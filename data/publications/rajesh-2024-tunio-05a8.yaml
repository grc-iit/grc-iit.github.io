  I/O operations are a known performance bottleneck of
  HPC applications. To achieve good performance, users often employ
  an iterative multistage tuning process to find an optimal I/O stack
  configuration. However, an I/O stack contains multiple layers, such
  as high-level I/O libraries, I/O middleware, and parallel file systems,
  and each layer has many parameters. These parameters and layers
  are entangled and influenced by each other. The tuning process is
  time-consuming and complex. In this work, we present TunIO, an AI-
  powered I/O tuning framework that implements several techniques to
  balance the tuning cost and performance gain, including tuning the high-
  impact parameters first. Furthermore, TunIO analyzes the application
  source code to extract its I/O kernel while retaining all statements
  necessary to perform I/O. It utilizes a smart selection of high-impact
  configuration parameters of the given tuning objective. Finally, it uses a
  novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven early stopping mechanism to
  balance the cost and performance gain. Experimental results show that
  TunIO leads to a reduction of up to â‰ˆ 73% in tuning time while achieving
  the same performance gain when compared to H5Tuner. It achieves a
  significant performance gain/cost of 208.4 MBps/min (I/O bandwidth for
  each minute spent in tuning) over existing approaches under our testing.
