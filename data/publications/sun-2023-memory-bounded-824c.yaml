  With the surge of big data applications and the worsening of the memory-wall
  problem, the memory system,

  instead of the computing unit, becomes the commonly recognized major concern
  of computing. However, this "memory-

  centric" common understanding has a humble beginning. More than three decades
  ago, the memory-bounded speedup

  model is the first model recognizing memory as the bound of computing and
  provided a general bound of speedup and a

  computing-memory trade-off formulation. The memory-bounded model was well
  received even by then. It was immediate-

  ly introduced in several advanced computer architecture and parallel computing
  textbooks in the 1990's as a must-know

  for scalable computing. These include Prof. Kai Hwang's book "Scalable
  Parallel Computing" in which he introduced the

  memory-bounded speedup model as the Sun-Ni's Law, parallel with the Amdahl's
  Law and the Gustafson's Law. Through

  the years, the impacts of this model have grown far beyond parallel processing
  and into the fundamental of computing. In

  this article, we revisit the memory-bounded speedup model and discuss its
  progress and impacts in depth to make a unique

  contribution to this special issue, to stimulate new solutions for big data
  applications, and to promote data-centric think-

  ing and rethinking.
