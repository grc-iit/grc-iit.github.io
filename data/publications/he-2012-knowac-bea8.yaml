abstract: |-
  The lasting memory-wall problem combined with
  the newly emerged big-data problem makes data access delay the
  first citizen of performance optimizations of cluster computing.
  Reduction of data access delay, however, is application dependent.
  It depends on the data access behaviors of the underlying
  applications. Therefore, leaning and understanding data access
  behaviors is a must for effective data access optimizations.
  Modern microprocessors are equipped with hardware data
  prefetchers, which predict data access patterns and prefetch data
  for CPU. However, memory systems in design do not have the
  capability to understand data access behaviors for performance
  optimizations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, named
  KNOWAC, to collect I/O information automatically through high-
  level I/O libraries. KNOWAC accumulates I/O knowledge and
  reveals data usage patterns by exploring the collected high-
  level I/O characteristics. The discovered data usage patterns can
  be used for different I/O optimizations. We apply KNOWAC
  to I/O prefetch under the framework of PnetCDF in this
  study. Experimental results on a real-world application show
  that KNOWAC is promising and has a true practical value in
  mitigating the I/O bottleneck.
