  Parallel file systems (PFS) are widely-used to ease the I/O bottleneck of
  modern high-performance computing systems.

  However, PFSs do not work well for small requests, especially small random
  requests. Newer Solid State Drives (SSD) have excellent

  performance on small random data accesses, but also incur a high monetary
  cost. In this study, we propose SLA-Cache, a Selective

  and Layout-Aware Cache system that employs a small set of SSD-based file
  servers as a cache of conventional HDD-based file

  servers. SLA-Cache uses a novel scheme to identify performance-critical data,
  and conducts a selective cache admission (SCA) policy

  to fully utilize SSD-based file servers. Moreover, since data layout of the
  cache system can also largely influence its access

  performance, SLA-Cache applies a layout-aware cache placement scheme (LCP) to
  store data on SSD-based file servers. By storing

  data with an optimal layout requiring the lowest access cost among three
  typical layout candidates, LCP can further improve system

  performance. We have implemented SLA-Cache under the MPICH2 I/O library.
  Experimental results show that SLA-Cache can

  significantly improve I/O throughput, and is a promising approach for parallel
  applications.
