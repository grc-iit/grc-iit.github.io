  Generalized speedup is defined as parallel speed
  over sequential speed. In this paper the generalized speedup and
  its relation with other existing performance metrics, such as tra-
  ditional speedup, efficiency, scalability, etc., are carefully studied.
  In terms of the introduced asymptotic speed, we show that the
  difference between the generalized speedup and the traditional
  speedup lies in the definition of the efficiency of uniprocessor
  processing, which is a very important issue in shared virtual
  memory machines. A scientific application has been implemented
  on a KSR-1 parallel computer. Experimental and theoretical re-
  sults show that the generalized speedup is distinct from the tradi-
  tional speedup and provides a more reasonable measurement. In
  the study of different speedups, an interesting relation between
  fixed-time and memory-bounded speedup is revealed. Various
  causes of superlinear speedup are also presented.
