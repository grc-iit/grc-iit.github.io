  Shared-nothing and shared-disk are the two most
  common storage architectures of parallel databases in the past
  two decades. Both two types of systems have their own merits
  for different applications. However, there are no much efforts
  in investigating the integration of these two architectures and
  exploiting their merits together. In this paper, we propose a
  novel hybrid storage architecture for large-scale data processing,
  to leverage the benefits of both shared-nothing and shared-disk
  architectures. In the proposed hybrid system, we adopt a shared-
  nothing architecture as the hardware layer and leverage a parallel
  file system as the storage layer to combine the scattered disks on
  all database nodes. We present an overall design of the new
  scheme, including data and storage organization, data access
  modes, and query processing methods. The proposed hybrid
  scheme can achieve both high I/O performance as a shared-
  nothing system, and high-speed data sharing across all server
  nodes as a share-disk system. Preliminary experimental results
  demonstrate that the hybrid scheme is promising and more
  appropriate for large-scale and data-intensive applications than
  each of the two individual types of systems.
