abstract: |-
  Parallel file systems (PFS) are commonly used in
  high-end computing systems. With the emergence of solid state
  drives (SSD), hybrid PFSs, which consist of both HDD and SSD
  servers, provide a practical I/O system solution for data-intensive
  applications. However, most existing PFS layout schemes are
  inefficient for hybrid PFSs due to their lack of awareness of the
  performance differences between heterogeneous servers and the
  workload changes between different parts of a file. This lack of
  recognition can result in severe I/O performance degradation. In
  this study, we propose a heterogeneity-aware region-level (HARL)
  data layout scheme to improve the data distribution of a hybrid
  PFS. HARL first divides a file into fine-grained, varying sized
  regions according to the changes of an application's I/O work-
  load, then chooses appropriate file stripe sizes on heterogeneous
  servers based on the server performance for each file region.
  Experimental results of representative benchmarks show that
  HARL can greatly improve the I/O system performance.
