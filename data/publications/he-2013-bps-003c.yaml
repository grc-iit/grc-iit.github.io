  It is known that I/O system rather than CPU and
  memory is the performance killer of many of the newly
  emerged data intensive applications. Evaluating and
  understanding I/O system performance has become a timely
  issue facing the high performance computing community.
  Conventional I/O performance metrics, such as
  Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS), bandwidth,
  response time, etc., are effective for traditional I/O
  environments. However, as I/O systems become more and
  more complex, existing I/O metrics become less and less able
  to catch the characteristic of I/O systems performance. In
  this study, we reveal the limitations of existing metrics, and
  introduce a novel I/O metric, Blocks Per Second (BPS), to
  measure the performance of the I/O systems. A unique merit
  of BPS is that it provides an overall I/O system performance,
  not the file system performance or disk performance. This is
  very important; since with concurrency and optimization at
  the I/O stacks, file system performance and disk
  performance no long represent the data access performance.
  In fact, they are often misleading. A methodology is designed
  to measure BPS, and experiments are conducted with
  various I/O access patterns and storage configurations.
  Experimental results show that BPS is significantly more
  appropriate than existing metrics in I/O performance
  evaluation.
