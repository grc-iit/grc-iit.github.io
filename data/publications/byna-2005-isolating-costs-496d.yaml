  ABSTRACT


  Communication in parallel applications is a combination of data transfers
  internally

  at a source or destination and across the network. Previous research focused
  on quantify-

  ing network transfer costs has indirectly resulted in reduced overall
  communication cost.

  Optimized data transfer from source memory to the network interface has
  received less

  attention. In shared memory systems, such memory-to-memory transfers dominate
  com-

  munication cost. In distributed memory systems, memory-to-network interface
  transfers

  grow in significance as processor and network speeds increase at faster rates
  than mem-

  ory latency speeds. Our objective is to minimize the cost of internal data
  transfers. The

  following examples illustrating the impact of memory transfers on
  communication, we

  present a methodology for classifying the effects of data size and data
  distribution on

  hardware, middleware, and application software performance. This cost is
  quantified

  using hardware counter event measurements on the SGI Origin 2000. For the SGI
  O2K,

  we empirically identify the cost caused by just copying data from one buffer
  to another

  and the middleware overhead. We use MPICH in our experiments, but our
  techniques

  are generally applicable to any communication implementation.
