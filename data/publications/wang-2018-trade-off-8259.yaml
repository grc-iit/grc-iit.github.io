abstract: |-
  Dragonfly networks are being widely adopted in
  high-performance computing systems. On these networks, how-
  ever, interference caused by resource sharing can lead to sig-
  nificant network congestion and performance variability. We
  present a comparative analysis exploring the trade-off between
  localizing communication and balancing network traffic. We
  conduct trace-based simulations for applications with different
  communication patterns, using multiple job placement policies
  and routing mechanisms. We perform an in-depth performance
  analysis on representative applications individually and show
  that different applications have distinct preferences regarding
  localized communication and balanced network traffic. We fur-
  ther demonstrate the effect of external network interference by
  introducing background traffic and show that localized commu-
  nication can help reduce the application performance variation
  caused by network sharing.
