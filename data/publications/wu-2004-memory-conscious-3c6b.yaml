abstract: |-
  While resource management and task scheduling are
  identified challenges of Grid computing, current Grid
  scheduling systems mainly focus on CPU and network
  availability. Recent performance improvement of CPU
  and computer network has made memory usage a
  significant factor of overall performance. In this study, we
  consider memory availability as a performance factor and
  introduce memory conscious task partition and
  scheduling. Three task partition policies are discussed.
  They are CPU-based, memory-based, and CPU-memory
  combined partition. We first investigate the three task
  partition policies on dedicated resources and verify the
  effectiveness of the CPU-memory combined partition
  algorithm in finding an optimal solution. We then extend
  the task partition policies in non-dedicated environments
  with the consideration of resource sharing. Analytical and
  experimental results show that the CPU-memory
  combined scheduling approach outperforms either the
  CPU-based or memory-based scheduling approach
  considerably for memory-intensive applications in Grid
  environments.
