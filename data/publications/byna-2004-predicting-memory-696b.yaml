  Improving memory performance at software level is more effective in reducing
  the rapidly expanding gap between processor and memory performance. Loop
  transformations (e.g. loop unrolling, loop tiling) and array restructuring
  optimizations improve the memory performance by increasing the locality of
  memory accesses. To find the best optimization parameters at runtime, we need
  a fast and simple analytical model to predict the memory access cost. Most of
  the existing models are complex and impractical to be integrated in the
  runtime tuning systems. In this paper, we propose a simple, fast and
  reasonably accurate model that is capable of predicting the memory access cost
  based on a wide range of data access patterns that appear in many scientific
  applications.
