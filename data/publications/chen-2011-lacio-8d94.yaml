abstract: |-
  Parallel applications benefit considerably from the
  rapid advance of processor architectures and the available mas-
  sive computational capability, but their performance suffers
  from large latency of I/O accesses. The poor I/O performance
  has been attributed as a critical cause of the low sustained
  performance of parallel systems. Collective I/O is widely
  considered a critical solution that exploits the correlation
  among I/O accesses from multiple processes of a parallel
  application and optimizes the I/O performance. However, the
  conventional collective I/O strategy makes the optimization
  decision based on the logical file layout to avoid multiple file
  system calls and does not take the physical data layout into
  consideration. On the other hand, the physical data layout in
  fact decides the actual I/O access locality and concurrency. In
  this study, we propose a new collective I/O strategy that is
  aware of the underlying physical data layout. We confirm that
  the new Layout-Aware Collective I/O (LACIO) improves the
  performance of current parallel I/O systems effectively with
  the help of noncontiguous file system calls. It holds promise in
  improving the I/O performance for parallel systems.
