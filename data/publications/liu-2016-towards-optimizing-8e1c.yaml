  The scale of scientific data generated by experi-
  mental facilities and simulations on high-performance computing
  facilities has been growing rapidly. In many cases, this data
  needs to be transferred rapidly and reliably to remote facilities
  for storage, analysis, sharing etc. At the same time, users want
  to verify the integrity of the data by doing a checksum after
  the data has been written to disk at the destination, to ensure
  the file has not been corrupted, for example due to network or
  storage data corruption, software bugs or human error. This end-
  to-end integrity verification creates additional overhead (extra
  disk I/O and more computation) and increases the overall data
  transfer time. In this paper, we evaluate strategies to maximize
  the overlap between data transfer and checksum computation.
  More specifically, we evaluate file-level and block-level (with
  various block sizes) pipelining to overlap data transfer and
  checksum computation. We evaluate these pipelining approaches
  in the context of GridFTP, a widely used protocol for science
  data transfers. We conducted both theoretical analysis and real
  experiments to evaluate our methods. The results show that
  block-level pipelining is an effective method in maximizing the
  overlap between data transfer and checksum computation and
  can improve the overall data transfer time with end-to-end
  integrity verification by up to 70% compared to the sequential
  execution of transfer and checksum, and by up to 60% compared
  to file-level pipelining.
