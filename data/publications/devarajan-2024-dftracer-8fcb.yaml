abstract: |-
  Modern HPC workflows involve intricate coupling
  of simulation, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI)
  applications to improve time to scientific insight. These workflows
  require a cohesive set of performance analysis tools to provide a
  comprehensive understanding of data exchange patterns in HPC
  systems. However, current tools are not designed to work with
  an AI-based I/O software stack that requires tracing at multiple
  levels of the application. To this end, we developed a data flow
  tracer called DFTracer to capture data-centric events from
  workflows and the I/O stack to build a detailed understanding
  of the data exchange within AI-driven workflows. DFTracer has
  the following three novel features, including a unified interface
  to capture trace data from different layers in the software stack,
  a trace format that is analysis-friendly and optimized to support
  efficiently loading multi-million events in a few seconds, and the
  capability to tag events with workflow-specific context to perform
  domain-centric data flow analysis for workflows. Additionally,
  we demonstrate that DFTracer has a 1.44x smaller runtime
  overhead and 1.3-7.1x smaller trace size than state-of-the-art
  tracing tools such as Score-P, Recorder, and Darshan. Moreover,
  with AI-driven workflows, Score-P, Recorder, and Darshan
  cannot find I/O accesses from dynamically spawned processes,
  and their load performance of 100M events is three orders of
  magnitude slower than DFTracer. In conclusion, we demonstrate
  that DFTracer can capture multi-level performance data,
  including contextual event tagging with a low overhead of 1-5%
  from AI-driven workflows such as MuMMI and Microsoft's
  Megatron Deepspeed running on large-scale HPC systems.
