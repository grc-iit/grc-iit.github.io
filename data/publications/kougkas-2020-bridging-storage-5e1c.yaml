abstract: >-
  In the era of data-intensive computing, large-scale applications, in both
  scientific and the BigData communities,

  demonstrate unique I/O requirements leading to a proliferation of different
  storage devices and software

  stacks, many of which have conflicting requirements. Further, new hardware
  technologies and system designs

  create a hierarchical composition that may be ideal for computational storage
  operations. In this paper, we

  investigate how to support a wide variety of conflicting I/O workloads under a
  single storage system. We

  introduce the idea of a Label, a new data representation, and, we present
  LABIOS: a new, distributed, Label-

  based I/O system. LABIOS boosts I/O performance by up to 17x via asynchronous
  I/O, supports heterogeneous

  storage resources, offers storage elasticity, and promotes in-situ analytics
  and software defined storage support

  via data provisioning. LABIOS demonstrates the effectiveness of storage
  bridging to support the convergence

  of HPC and BigData workloads on a single platform.
