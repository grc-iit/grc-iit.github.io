  Many scientific applications spend a significant
  portion of their execution time in accessing data from files.
  Various optimization techniques exist to improve data access
  performance, such as data prefetching and data layout
  optimization. However, optimization process is usually a
  difficult task due to the complexity involved in understanding
  I/O behavior. Tools that can help simplify the optimization
  process have a significant importance. In this paper, we
  introduce a tool, called IOSIG, for providing a better
  understanding of parallel I/O accesses and information to be
  used for optimization techniques. The tool enables tracing
  parallel I/O calls of an application and analyzing the collected
  information to provide a clear understanding of I/O behavior
  of the application. We show that performance overheads of the
  tool in trace collection and analysis are negligible. The analysis
  step creates I/O signatures that various optimizations can use
  for improving I/O performance. I/O signatures are compact,
  easy-to-understand,
  and parameterized representations
  containing data access pattern information such as size, strides
  between consecutive accesses, repetition, timing, etc. The
  signatures include local I/O behavior for each process and
  global behavior for an overall application. We illustrate the
  usage of the IOSIG tool in data prefetching and data layout
  optimizations.
