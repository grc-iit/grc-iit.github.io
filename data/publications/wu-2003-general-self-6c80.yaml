  The efforts to construct a national scale grid computing 

  environment has brought unprecedented computing 

  capacity. Exploiting this complex infrastructure requires 

  efficient middleware to support the execution of a 

  distributed application, composed of a set of subtasks, for 

  best performance. This presents the challenge how to 

  schedule these subtasks in shared heterogeneous systems. 

  Current work has several limitations. Most scheduling 

  systems are based on determined estimation of task 

  completion time. Current application-level scheduling 

  algorithms are too closely coupled with application 

  internal structures. The application performance may 

  suffer when some resources represent abnormal usage 

  pattern during applications execution. To address these 

  issues, we develop a prototype of Grid Harvest Service 

  (GHS) to provide dynamic and self-adaptive task 

  scheduling. Experimental results show GHS outperforms 

  current systems in scheduling large applications in a non dedicated
  heterogeneous environment.
