abstract: |-
  The application of hardware-parameterized models to
  distributed systems can result in omission of key
  bottlenecks such as the full cost of inter-node
  communication in a shared memory cluster. However,
  inclusion in the model of message characteristics and
  complex memory hierarchies may result in impractical
  models. Nonetheless, the growing gap between memory
  and CPU performance combined with the trend toward
  large scale clustered shared memory platforms implies an
  increased need to consider the impact of local memory
  communication on parallel processing in distributed
  systems. We present a simple and useful model of point-
  to-point memory communication to predict and analyze
  the latency of memory copy, pack and unpack. We use the
  model to isolate contributions of hardware, middleware,
  and software to data transfers on Intel- and MIPS-based
  platforms.
