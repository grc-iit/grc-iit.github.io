  In a dynamic environment where a process can migrate from one host to another
  host, communication state transfer is a

  key issue of process coordination. This paper presents a set of data
  communication and process migration protocols to support

  communication state transfer in a dynamic, distributed parallel environment.
  The protocols preserve the semantics of point-to-point

  communication; they guarantee message delivery, maintain message ordering, and
  do not introduce deadlock when blocking send or

  receive operations are performed during process migration. Analytical proofs
  and prototype implementation are conducted to confirm

  the correctness of the protocols. Analytical and experimental results show the
  proposed design is valid and has a true potential in

  network computing.
