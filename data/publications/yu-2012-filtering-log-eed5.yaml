  Log data is an incredible asset for troubleshooting
  in large-scale systems. Nevertheless, due to the ever-growing
  system scale, the volume of such data becomes overwhelming,
  bringing enormous burdens on both data storage and data
  analysis. To address this problem, we present a 2-dimensional
  online filtering mechanism to remove redundant and noisy data
  via feature selection and instance selection. The objective of this
  work is two-fold: (i) to significantly reduce data volume without
  losing important information, and (ii) to effectively promote data
  analysis. We evaluate this new filtering mechanism by means of
  real environmental data from the production supercomputers at
  Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory.
  Our preliminary results demonstrate that our method can reduce
  more than 85% disk space, thereby significantly reducing analysis
  time. Moreover, it also facilitates better failure prediction and
  diagnosis by more than 20%, as compared to the conventional
  predictive approach relying on RAS (Reliability, Availability, and
  Serviceability) events alone.
