  Accesses Per Cycle (APC), Concurrent Average Memory Access Time (C-AMAT), and
  Layered Performance

  Matching (LPM) are three memory performance models that consider both data
  locality and memory assess concurrency.

  The APC model measures the throughput of a memory architecture and therefore
  reflects the quality of service (QoS) of

  a memory system. The C-AMAT model provides a recursive expression for the
  memory access delay and therefore can be

  used for identifying the potential bottlenecks in a memory hierarchy. The LPM
  method transforms a global memory system

  optimization into localized optimizations at each memory layer by matching the
  data access demands of the applications with

  the underlying memory system design. These three models have been proposed
  separately through prior efforts. This paper

  reexamines the three models under one coherent mathematical framework. More
  specifically, we present a new memory-

  centric view of data accesses. We divide the memory cycles at each memory
  layer into four distinct categories and use them

  to recursively define the memory access latency and concurrency along the
  memory hierarchy. This new perspective offers

  new insights with a clear formulation of the memory performance considering
  both locality and concurrency. Consequently,

  the performance model can be easily understood and applied in engineering
  practices. As such, the memory-centric approach

  helps establish a unified mathematical foundation for model-driven performance
  analysis and optimization of contemporary

  and future memory systems.
