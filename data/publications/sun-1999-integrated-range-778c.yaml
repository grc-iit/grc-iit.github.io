  A major difficulty in restructuring compilation, and in parallel programming
  in general, is how to compare parallel

  performance over a range of system and problem sizes. Execution time varies
  with system and problem size and an initially fast

  implementation may become slow when system and problem size scale up. This
  paper introduces the concept of range comparison.

  Unlike conventional execution time comparison in which performance is compared
  for a particular system and problem size, range

  comparison compares the performance of programs over a range of ensemble and
  problem sizes via scalability and performance

  crossing point analysis. A novel algorithm is developed to predict the
  crossing point automatically. The correctness of the algorithm is

  proven and a methodology is developed to integrate range comparison into
  restructuring compilations for data-parallel programming. A

  preliminary prototype of the methodology is implemented and tested under
  Vienna Fortran Compilation System. Experimental results

  demonstrate that range comparison is feasible and effective. It is an
  important asset for program evaluation, restructuring compilation,

  and parallel programming.
