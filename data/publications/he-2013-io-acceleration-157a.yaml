  The I/O bottleneck in high-performance computing is becoming
  worse as application data continues to grow. In this work, we
  explore how patterns of I/O within these applications can signif-
  icantly affect the effectiveness of the underlying storage systems
  and how these same patterns can be utilized to improve many as-
  pects of the I/O stack and mitigate the I/O bottleneck. We offer
  three main contributions in this paper. First, we develop and eval-
  uate algorithms by which I/O patterns can be efficiently discovered
  and described. Second, we implement one such algorithm to re-
  duce the metadata quantity in a virtual parallel file system by up to
  several orders of magnitude, thereby increasing the performance of
  writes and reads by up to 40 and 480 percent respectively. Third,
  we build a prototype file system with pattern-aware prefetching and
  evaluate it to show a 46 percent reduction in I/O latency. Finally,
  we believe that efficient pattern discovery and description, coupled
  with the observed predictability of complex patterns within many
  high-performance applications, offers significant potential to en-
  able many additional I/O optimizations.
