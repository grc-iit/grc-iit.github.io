abstract: |-
  Traditional memory performance metrics, such as average memory access time
  (AMAT), are designed for sequential data accesses and can prove misleading for
  contemporary cache technologies that increasingly rely on access concurrency.
  C-AMAT, a new performance metric, accounts for concurrency at both the
  component and system levels for modern memory design.
