abstract: |-
  The efforts to construct a national scale Grid
  computing environment have brought unprecedented
  computing capacity and complicacy. Exploiting this
  complex infrastructure requires efficient middleware to
  support the execution of distributed applications, which
  presents the challenge on how to schedule tasks in shared
  heterogeneous systems. Most existing scheduling systems
  are based on pre-determined estimation of task completion
  time and resources availability. They may not provide
  appropriate scheduling if the underlying computing
  resources present an abnormal usage pattern during an
  application execution.
  For solving long-running
  applications in a large-scale Grid environment, abnormal
  usage of some resource may not be uncommon. We have
  proposed the development of the Grid Harvest Service
  (GHS) performance evaluation and task scheduling system
  in our previous work. In this study, we present a novel
  dynamic self-adaptive scheduling algorithm and its
  implementation under GHS. Scheduling and re-scheduling
  algorithms and mechanisms are carefully investigated.
  Experimental results show that, equipped with these new
  scheduling mechanisms, GHS outperforms existing systems
  considerably in scheduling large applications in a non-
  dedicated heterogeneous environment.
