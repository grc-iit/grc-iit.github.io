  General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) have
  become a popular platform to accelerate high performance
  applications. Although they provide exceptional computing
  power, GPGPU impose significant pressure on the off-chip
  memory system. Evaluating, understanding, and improving
  GPGPU data access delay has become an important research topic
  in high-performance computing. In this study, we utilize the
  newly proposed GPGPU/C-AMAT (Concurrent Average Memory
  Access Time) model to quantitatively evaluate GPGPU memory
  performance. Specifically, we extend the current C-AMAT model
  to include a GPGPU-specific modeling component and then
  provide its evaluation results.
