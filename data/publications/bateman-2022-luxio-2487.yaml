  Abstract-Storage in HPC is typically a single Remote and Static
  Storage (RSS) resource. However, applications demonstrate diverse I/O
  requirements that can be better served by a multi-storage approach. Cur-
  rent practice employs ephemeral storage systems running on either node-
  local or shared storage resources. Yet, the burden of provisioning and
  configuring intermediate storage falls solely on the users, while global job
  schedulers offer little to no support for custom deployments. This lack of
  support often leads to over- or under-provisioning of resources and poorly
  configured storage systems. To mitigate this, we present LuxIO, an intelli-
  gent storage resource provisioning and auto-configuration service. LuxIO
  constructs storage deployments configured to best match I/O require-
  ments. LuxIO-tuned storage services show performance improvements
  up to 2x across common applications and benchmarks, while introducing
  minimal overhead of 93.40 ms on top of existing job scheduling pipelines.
  LuxIO improves resource utilization by up to 25% in select workflows.
