abstract: |-
  In this paper we present Horizon, a distributed graph processing
  framework achieving close to native performance without penal-
  izing productivity by providing a multi-layer, multi-abstraction
  model of computation. Compared to current frameworks, Horizon
  extends the scope of computation by exposing two notions usually
  relegated to implementations: graph data models and communica-
  tion models. Horizon can reduce execution time by an average of
  5.3Ã— across different applications and datasets and process an order
  of magnitude larger graphs when compared to the state of the art.
