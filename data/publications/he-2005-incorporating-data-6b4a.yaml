  Task Scheduling is a critical design issue of distributed computing.

  The emerging Grid computing infrastructure consists of heterogeneous

  resources in widely distributed autonomous domains and makes task scheduling

  even more challenging. Grid considers both static, unmovable hardware and

  moveable, replicable data as computing resources. While intensive research has

  been done on task scheduling on hardware computing resources and on data

  replication protocols, how to incorporate data movement into task scheduling

  seamlessly is unrevealed. We consider data movement as a dimension of task

  scheduling. A dynamic data structure, Data Distance Table (DDT), is proposed

  to provide real-time data distribution and communication information. Based on

  DDT, a data-conscious task scheduling heuristics is introduced to minimize the

  data access delay. A simulated Grid environment is set up to test the
  efficiency

  of the newly proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that for data

  intensive tasks, the dynamic data-conscious scheduling outperforms the

  conventional Min-Min significantly.
