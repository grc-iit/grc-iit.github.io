  Process migration is essential for runtime load
  balancing.
  In Grid and shared networked
  environments, load imbalance is not only caused by the
  dynamic nature of underlying applications, but also by
  the fluctuation of resource availability. In a shared
  environment, tasks need to be rescheduled frequently
  to adapt the variation of resources availability. Unlike
  conventional task scheduling, dynamic rescheduling
  has to consider process migration costs in its
  formulation. In this study, we first model the migration
  cost and introduce an effective method to predict the
  cost. We then introduce a dynamic scheduling
  mechanism that considers migration cost as well as
  other conventional influential factors for performance
  optimization in a shared, heterogeneous environment.
  Finally we present experimental testing to verify the
  analytical results. Experimental results show that the
  proposed dynamic scheduling system is feasible and
  improves the system performance considerably.
