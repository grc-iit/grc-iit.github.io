abstract: |-
  Checkpoint/recovery has been studied extensively,
  and various optimization techniques have been
  presented for its improvement. Regardless of the
  considerable research efforts, little work has been
  done on improving its restart latency. The time spent
  on retrieving and loading the checkpoint image during
  a recovery is non-trivial, especially in networked
  environments. With the ever-increasing application
  memory footprint and system failure rate, it is
  becoming more of an issue. In this paper, we present a
  Fast Restart Mechanism called FREM. It allows fast
  restart of a failed process without requiring the
  availability of the entire checkpoint image. By
  dynamically tracking the process data accesses after
  each checkpoint, FREM masks restart latency by
  overlapping the computation of the resumed process
  with the retrieval of its checkpoint image. We have
  implemented FREM with the BLCR checkpointing tool
  in Linux systems. Our experiments with the SPEC
  benchmarks indicate that it can effectively reduce
  restart latency by 61.96% on average in networked
  environments.
