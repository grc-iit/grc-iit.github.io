  I/O data access is a recognized performance bottleneck of high-end
  computing. Several commercial and research parallel file systems
  have been developed in recent years to ease the performance bot-
  tleneck. These advanced file systems perform well on some appli-
  cations but may not perform well on others. They have not reached
  their full potential in mitigating the I/O-wall problem. Data access
  is application dependent. Based on the application-specific opti-
  mization principle, in this study we propose a cost-intelligent data
  access strategy to improve the performance of parallel file systems.
  We first present a novel model to estimate data access cost of differ-
  ent data layout policies. Next, we extend the cost model to calculate
  the overall I/O cost of any given application and choose an appro-
  priate layout policy for the application. A complex application may
  consist of different data access patterns. Averaging the data access
  patterns may not be the best solution for those complex applica-
  tions that do not have a dominant pattern. We then further propose
  a hybrid data replication strategy for those applications, so that a
  file can have replications with different layout policies for the best
  performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental testing have
  been conducted to verify the newly proposed cost-intelligent lay-
  out approach. Analytical and experimental results show that the
  proposed cost model is effective and the application-specific data
  layout approach achieved up to 74% performance improvement for
  data-intensive applications.
