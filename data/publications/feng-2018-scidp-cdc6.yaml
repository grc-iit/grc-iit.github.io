abstract: |-
  Modern High Performance Computing (HPC) ap-
  plications, such as Earth science simulations, produce large
  amounts of data due to the surging of computing power, while
  big data applications have become more compute-intensive due
  to increasingly sophisticated analysis algorithms. The needs of
  both HPC and big data technologies for advanced HPC and
  big data applications create a demand for integrated system
  support. In this study, we introduce Scientific Data Processing
  (SciDP) to support both HPC and big data applications via
  integrated scientific data processing. SciDP can directly process
  scientific data stored on a Parallel File System (PFS), which
  is typically deployed in an HPC environment, in a big data
  programming environment running atop Hadoop Distributed File
  System (HDFS). SciDP seamlessly integrates PFS, HDFS, and the
  widely-used R data analysis system to support highly efficient
  processing of scientific data. It utilizes the merits of both PFS
  and HDFS for fast data transfer, overlaps computing with
  data accessing, and integrates R into the data transfer process.
  Experimental results show that SciDP accelerates analysis and
  visualization of a production NASA Center for Climate Simulation
  (NCCS) climate and weather application by 6x to 8x when
  compared to existing solutions.
