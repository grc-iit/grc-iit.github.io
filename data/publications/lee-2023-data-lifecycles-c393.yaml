  A critical performance challenge in distributed scientific workflows
  is coordinating tasks and data flows on distributed resources. To
  guide these decisions, this paper introduces data flow lifecycle anal-
  ysis. Workflows are commonly represented using directed acyclic
  graphs (DAGs). Data flow lifecycles (DFL) enrich task DAGs with
  data objects and properties that describe data flow and how tasks
  interact with that flow. Lifecycles enable analysis from several
  important perspectives: task, data, and data flow. We describe rep-
  resentation, measurement, analysis, visualization, and opportunity
  identification for DFLs. Our measurement is both distributed and
  scalable, using space that is constant per data file. We use lifecycles
  and opportunity analysis to reason about improved task placement
  and reduced data movement for five scientific workflows with dif-
  ferent characteristics. Case studies show improvements of 15x, 1.9Ã—,
  and 10-30x. Our work is implemented in the DataLife tool.
