abstract: |-
  High performance computers rely on large memories to cache data
  and improve performance. However, managing the ever-increasing
  number of levels in the memory hierarchy becomes increasingly
  difficult. The Disaggregated Memory System (DMS) architecture
  was introduced in recent years for better memory utilization. DMS
  is a global memory pool between the local memories and storage.
  To leverage DMS, we need a better understanding of its perfor-
  mance and how to exploit its full potential. In this study, we first
  present a DMS performance model for performance evaluation and
  analysis. We next conduct a thorough performance evaluation to
  identify application-DMS characteristics under different system
  configurations. Experimental tests are conducted on the RAM Area
  Network (RAN), a DMS implementation available at the Argonne
  National Laboratory, for performance evaluation. Then, the results
  of performance experiments are presented along with an analysis of
  the pros and cons of the RAN-DMS design and implementation. The
  counterintuitive performance results for the K-means application
  are analyzed at code-level to illustrate DMS performance. Finally,
  based on our findings, we present some discussions on future DMS
  design and its potential on AI applications.
