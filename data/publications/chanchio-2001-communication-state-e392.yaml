abstract: >-
  In a dynamic environment, where a process can be migrated from one host to an-

  other host, communication state transfer is a key issue of process
  coordination. This

  paper presents algorithms for data communication and migration protocols to
  support

  communication state transfer in a dynamic, distributed parallel environment.
  These

  algorithms collectively preserve the semantics of the communication and
  support com-

  munication state transfer. The assumptions and validity of our solution are
  discussed

  and analyzed. Based on our early results in process migration, we implement a
  proto-

  type system for process state transfer. Experimental results confirm our
  design is valid

  and has a true potential in practice.
