  We present H2DP, a holistic heterogeneity-aware data placement scheme for
  hybrid parallel I/O systems, which consist of

  HDD servers and SSD servers. Most of the existing approaches focus on server
  performance or application I/O pattern heterogeneity

  in data placement. H2DP considers three axes of heterogeneity: server
  performance, server space, and application I/O pattern. More

  specifically, H2DP determines the optimized stripe sizes on servers based on
  server performance, keeps only critical data on all hybrid

  servers and the rest data on HDD servers, and dynamically migrates data among
  different types of servers at run-time. This holistic

  heterogeneity-awareness enables H2DP to achieve high performance by
  alleviating server load imbalance, efficiently utilizing SSD

  space, and accommodating application pattern variation. We have implemented a
  prototype of H2DP under MPICH2 atop OrangeFS.

  Extensive experimental results demonstrate that H2DP significantly improve I/O
  system performance compared to existing data

  placement schemes.
