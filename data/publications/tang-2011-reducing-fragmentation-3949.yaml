  Torus-based networks are prevalent on leadership-class petascale systems,
  providing a good balance between network cost and performance. The major
  disadvantage of this network architecture is its susceptibility to
  fragmentation. Many studies have attempted to reduce resource fragmentation in
  this architecture. Although the approaches suggested can make good allocation
  decisions reducing fragmentation at job start time, none of them considers a
  job's walltime, which can cause resource fragmentation when neighboring jobs
  do not complete closely. In this paper, we propose a walltime-aware job
  allocation strategy, which adjacently packs jobs that finish around the same
  time, in order to minimize resource fragmentation caused by job length
  discrepancy. Event-driven simulations using real job traces from a production
  Blue Gene/P system at Argonne National Laboratory demonstrate that our
  walltime-aware strategy can effectively reduce system fragmentation and
  improve overall system performance.
