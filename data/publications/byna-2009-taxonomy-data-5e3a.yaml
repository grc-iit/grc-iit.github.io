abstract: >-
  Data prefetching is an effective data access latency hiding technique to mask
  the CPU stall caused by cache

  misses and to bridge the performance gap between processor and memory. With
  hardware and/or software support, data

  prefetching brings data closer to a processor before it is actually needed.
  Many prefetching techniques have been developed

  for single-core processors. Recent developments in processor technology have
  brought multicore processors into mainstream.

  While some of the single-core prefetching techniques are directly applicable
  to multicore processors, numerous novel strategies

  have been proposed in the past few years to take advantage of multiple cores.
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive

  review of the state-of-the-art prefetching techniques, and proposes a taxonomy
  that classifies various design concerns in

  developing a prefetching strategy, especially for multicore processors. We
  compare various existing methods through analysis

  as well.
