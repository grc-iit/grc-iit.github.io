  Cache management is a critical aspect of computer
  architecture, encompassing techniques such as cache replace-
  ment, bypassing, and prefetching. Existing research has often fo-
  cused on individual techniques, overlooking the potential benefits
  of joint optimization. Moreover, many of these approaches rely
  on static and intuition-driven policies, limiting their performance
  under complex and dynamic workloads. To address these chal-
  lenges, this paper introduceesCHROME,a novelty
  aware cache management framework. CHROME takes a holistic
  approach by seamlessly integrating intelligent cache replacement
  and bypassing with pattern-based prefetching. By leveraging
  online reinforcement learning, CHROME dynamically adapts
  cache decisions based on multiple program features and applies a
  reward for each decision that considers the accuracy of the action
  and the system-level feedback information. Our performance
  evaluation demonstrates that CHROME outperforms current
  state-of-the-art schemes, exhibiting significant improvements in
  cache management. Notably, CHROME achieves a remarkable
  performance boost of up to 13.7% over the traditional LRU
  method in multi-core systems with only modest overhead.
