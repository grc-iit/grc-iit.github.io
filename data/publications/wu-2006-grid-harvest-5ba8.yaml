  Conventional performance evaluation mechanisms focus on dedicated systems.
  Grid computing infrastructure, on the other hand, is a shared

  collaborative environment constructed on virtual organizations. Each
  organization has its own resource management policy and usage pattern.

  The non-dedicated characteristic of Grid computing prevents the leverage of
  conventional performance evaluation systems. In this study, we

  introduce the grid harvest service (GHS) performance evaluation and task
  scheduling system for solving large-scale applications in a shared

  environment. GHS is based on a novel performance prediction model and a set of
  task scheduling algorithms. GHS supports three classes

  of task scheduling, single task, parallel processing and meta-task.
  Experimental results show that GHS provides a satisfactory solution for

  performance prediction and task scheduling of large applications and has a
  real potential.
