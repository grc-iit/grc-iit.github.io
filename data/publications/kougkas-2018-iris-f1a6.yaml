  There is an ocean of available storage solutions in modern high-performance
  and distributed systems. These solutions consist of Par-

  allel File Systems (PFS) for the more traditional high-performance computing
  (HPC) systems and of Object Stores for emerging cloud

  environments. More often than not, these storage solutions are tied to
  specific APIs and data models and thus, bind developers,

  applications, and entire computing facilities to using certain inter-faces.
  Each storage system is designed and optimized for certain

  applications but does not perform well for others. Furthermore,

  modern applications have become more and more complex consist-

  ing of a collection of phases with different computation and I/O

  requirements. In this paper, we propose a unified storage access

  system, called IRIS (i.e., I/O Redirection via Integrated Storage). IRIS

  enables unified data access and seamlessly bridges the semantic

  gap between file systems and object stores. With IRIS, emerging

  High-Performance Data Analytics software has capable and diverse

  I/O support. IRIS can bring us closer to the convergence of HPC

  and Cloud environments by combining the best storage subsystems

  from both worlds. Experimental results show that IRIS can grant

  more than 7x improvement in performance than existing solutions.
