  Grids have become a critical asset in large-scale
  scientific and engineering research. Accessing to
  distributed data is typically as important as access
  to distributed computational resources. In this pa-
  per, we present the design of Java CoG Kit compo-
  nents and APIs that make handling of data accessed
  through Grids easier for the novice Grid user and
  programmer. We introduce the design and archi-
  tecture of a component for file transfers that sep-
  arates issues related to requesting, performing and
  visualizing the actual file transfer. The design of
  our component is based on object and component
  based methodologies. Hence, it is assembled from
  a collection of reusable components promoting cus-
  tomization and reuse. We integrated the drag-and-
  drop paradigm. Protocol-independent interfaces al-
  low easy adaptation to a variety of data sources.
  Hence, we not only have developed a GUI but so-
  phisticated middleware to develop advanced Grid
  file transfer services. These components are dis-
  tributed with the Java CoG Kit.
