abstract: |-
  Prefetching techniques have been studied for
  decades. However, there are few studies on how concurrent
  memory accesses may affect prefetching effectiveness. When
  there are multiple concurrent memory requests, we can classify
  them into sub-classes by analyzing the overlapping relationship.
  In this work, we first propose pure prefetch coverage (PPC), a
  novel prefetching metric that can identify an accurate prefetch
  coverage under the concurrent memory access model. Then
  we propose APAC, an adaptive prefetch framework with PPC
  metric that can capture the dynamics of applications and adjust
  the prefetching aggressiveness. Our experimental results show
  that the PPC metric has a higher IPC correlation compared to
  the conventional prefetch coverage (PC) metric. For memory-
  intensive single-thread benchmarks, APAC provides an average
  performance improvement by 17.3% and 5.9% compared to the
  state-of-the-art adaptive prefetch framework FDP and NST. In
  a multi-core system, APAC outperforms FDP and NST by 8.5%
  and 5.0% IPC on average, respectively.
