  Maximal biclique enumeration (MBE) is crucial
  in bipartite graph analysis. Recent studies rely on extensive
  set intersections on static bipartite graphs to solve the MBE
  problem. However, the computational subgraphs dynamically
  change during enumeration, leading to redundant memory ac-
  cesses and degraded set intersection performance. To overcome
  this limitation, we propose an AdaMBE algorithm. First, we
  redesign its core operations using local neighborhood information
  derived from computational subgraphs to minimize redundant
  memory accesses. Second, we dynamically create computational
  subgraphs using bitmaps leveraging its fast bitwise operations
  to accelerate set intersections. Finally, we integrate them in
  AdaMBE. Our experimental results show that AdaMBE is
  1.6x-49.7Ã— faster than its closest CPU-based competitor and
  successfully enumerates all 19 billion maximal bicliques on the
  TVTropes dataset, a large task beyond the capabilities of existing
  algorithms. Notably, on certain datasets, our parallel version,
  ParAdaMBE, on CPUs even outperforms GMBE on GPUs by
  up to 5.07x.
