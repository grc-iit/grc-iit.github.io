abstract: |-
  Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a critical com-
  putational kernel in numerous scientific and machine learn-
  ing applications. SpMM involves massive irregular memory
  accesses and poses great challenges to conventional cache-
  based computer architectures. Recently dedicated SpMM
  accelerators have been proposed to enhance SpMM per-
  formance. However, current SpMM accelerators still face
  challenges in adapting to varied sparse patterns, fully ex-
  ploiting inherent parallelism, and optimizing cache perfor-
  mance. To address these issues, we introduce ACES, a novel
  SpMM accelerator in this study. First, ACES features an
  adaptive execution flow that dynamically adjusts to diverse
  sparse patterns. The adaptive execution flow balances par-
  allel computing efficiency and data reuse. Second, ACES
  incorporates locality-concurrency co-optimizations within
  the global cache. ACES utilizes a concurrency-aware cache
  management policy, which considers data locality and con-
  currency for optimal replacement decisions. Additionally, the
  integration of a non-blocking buffer with the global cache en-
  hances concurrency and reduces computational stalls. Third,
  the hardware architecture of ACES is designed to integrate
  all innovations. The architecture ensures efficient support
  across the adaptive execution flow, advanced cache opti-
  mizations, and fine-grained parallel processing. Our perfor-
  mance evaluation demonstrates that ACES significantly out-
  performs existing solutions, providing a 2.1Ã— speedup and
  marking a substantial advancement in SpMM acceleration.
