  At GCC 2003 in Shanghai in December 2003, a panel discussion was held on the
  future of Grid computing

  and on the role of the Globus Toolkit in future Grid standards. Panelists
  include Andrew Chien (UCSD, USA), Wolfgang

  Gentzsch (Sun), Francis Lau (HKU, China), Carl Kesselman (USC, USA), Satoshi
  Matsuoka (TIT, Japan), Xian-He Sun

  (IIT, USA), Richard Wirt (Intel), Liang-Jie Zhang (IBM Research) and Song-Nian
  Zhou (Platform Computing). The panel

  talks were stimulating and well received. Three of the panel talk notes are
