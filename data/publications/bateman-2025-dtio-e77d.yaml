abstract: |-
  HPC, Big Data Analytics, and Machine Learning have become in-
  creasingly intertwined as popular models such as LLMs and Diffusion
  Models have been driving discovery in scientific fields. However,
  each of these domains has its own storage infrastructure with unique
  I/O interfaces and storage systems, requiring feature sets that are
  often incompatible. Users with experience in one domain lack the
  expertise to change their applications to match the data stacks of
  the other domains, necessitating expensive conversions. There is
  a need for a transparent solution for the unification of disparate
  data stacks for the triple convergence of HPC, Big Data, and ML
  that can provide the required functionality while achieving higher
  performance. To better support converged HPC, Big Data, and ML
  workflows, this paper proposes DTIO, a scalable I/O runtime that
  unifies the disparate I/O stack for modern scientific ML workflows.
  DTIO utilizes a unique DataTask abstraction to express the move-
  ment of data, its ordering, and its dependencies on other data as a
  task. DTIO achieves a unification of scientific and ML workflows
  by utilizing intelligent mapping of interfaces, and automatically de-
  termines the best method to relate their unique semantics. DTIO's
  online translation with DataTask caching can improve performance
  by 49.6% compared to offline translation methods. DTIO also offers
  numerous optimizations, such as asynchronous I/O and aggregation.
