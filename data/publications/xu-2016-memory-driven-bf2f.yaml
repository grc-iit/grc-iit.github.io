abstract: |-
  Concurrent execution of GPU tasks is available
  in modern GPU device. However, limited device memory
  is an obvious bottleneck in executing many GPU tasks.
  And the task priority and system performance are often
  ignored. To address these, a real-time GPU scheduling
  scheme is proposed in this paper. A reservation algorithm
  based on device memory(RBDM) is adopted to provide more
  opportunity for the High-priority task in the scheme. high
  priority first wake (HPFW) and small memory HPFW (SM-
  HPFW) are employed in the scheduling of waiting tasks to
  improve the priority response time and system performance.
  A CPU-based monitor is developed to check the GPU task
  execution. Experiments show the RBDM can work effec-
  tively. Compared with FIFO, HPFW can decrease overall
  priority response time significantly. Overall task completion
  time can be reduced by 20% using the SM-HPFW while the
  distribution of device memory requirement of GPU tasks is
  even.
