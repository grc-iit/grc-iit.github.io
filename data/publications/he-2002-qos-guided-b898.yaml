  Task scheduling is an integrated component of computing. With the emergence of
  grid and ubiquitous computing, newer challenges have arisen in task
  scheduling. Unlike traditional parallel computing, grid is a shared
  enterprising environment where is no central control. The goal of grid task
  scheduling is to achieve high system throughput and to match the application
  needs with the available computing resources. This matching of resources in a
  non-deterministically shared heterogeneous environment leads to concerns on
  Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper we introduce a novel QoS guided task
  scheduling algorithm for grid computing. This new algorithm is based on the
  general adaptive scheduling heuristics and an added in QoS guide component. It
  has been tested in a simulated grid environment. The experimental results show
  that the new QoS guided min-min heuristic can lead to significant performance
  gain in various applications, and it is as tolerable as existing heuristics
  for inaccurate inputs of computing resources.
