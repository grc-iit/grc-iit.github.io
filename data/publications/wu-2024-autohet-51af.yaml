abstract: |-
  ReRAM-based accelerators have become prevalent in accelerating
  deep neural network inference owing to their in-situ computing ca-
  pability of ReRAM crossbars. However, most existing ReRAM-based
  accelerators are designed with homogeneous crossbars, leading to
  either low resource utilization or sub-optimal energy efficiency.
  In this paper, we propose AUTOHET, an automated heterogeneous
  ReRAM-based accelerator with varied-size crossbars for different
  DNN layers. To achieve both high crossbar utilization and energy
  efficiency, AUTOHET uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to
  automatically determine the proper crossbar configuration for each
  DNN layer. Additionally, AUTOHET introduces rectangle crossbars
  and a tile-shared crossbar allocation scheme to reduce crossbar
  wastage and energy consumption. Experiment results show that
  AUTOHET effectively improves crossbar utilization by up to 3.1Ã—
  and reduces energy consumption by up to 94.6%, compared to ap-
  proaches with homogeneous ReRAM crossbars.
