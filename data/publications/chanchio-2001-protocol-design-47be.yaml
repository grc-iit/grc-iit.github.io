  This paper presents the design of a communication state
  transfer protocol to support process migration in a dynamic,
  distributed computing environment. In our design, pro-
  cesses in distributed computation communicate one another
  via message passing and are migration-enabled. Due to mo-
  bility, mechanisms to maintain reliability and correctness of
  data communication are needed. Following an event-based
  approach, such mechanisms are derived to handle various
  communication situations when a process migrates. These
  mechanisms collectively preserve the semantics of the com-
  munication and support efficient communication state trans-
  fer.
