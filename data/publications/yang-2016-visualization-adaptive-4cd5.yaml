abstract: |-
  Data analytics becomes increasingly important in
  big data applications. Adaptively subsetting large amounts of
  data to extract the interesting events such as the centers of
  hurricane or thunderstorm, statistically analyzing and visualizing
  the subset data, is an effective way to analyze ever-growing data.
  This is particularly crucial for analyzing Earth Science data,
  such as extreme weather. The Hadoop ecosystem (i.e., HDFS,
  MapReduce, Hive) provides a cost-efficient big data management
  environment and is being explored for analyzing big Earth
  Science data.
  Our study investigates the potential of a MapReduce-like
  paradigm to perform statistical calculations, and utilizes the
  calculated results to subset as well as visualize data in a scalable
  and efficient way. RHadoop and SparkR are deployed to enable
  R to access and process data in parallel with Hadoop and
  Spark, respectively. The regular R libraries and tools are utilized
  to create and manipulate images. Statistical calculations, such
  as maximum and average variable values, are carried with R
  or SQL. We have developed a strategy to conduct query and
  visualization within one phase, and thus significantly improve the
  overall performance in a scalable way. The technical challenges
  and limitations of both Hadoop and Spark platforms for R are
  also discussed.
