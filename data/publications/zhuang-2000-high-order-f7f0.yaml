  We present a multilevel high order ADI method for separable generalized
  Helmholtz equations. The discretization method we use is a one- dimensional
  fourth order compact finite difference applied to each directional component
  of the Laplace operator, resulting in a discrete system efficiently solvable
  by ADI methods. We apply this high order difference scheme to all levels of
  grids, and then starting from the coarsest grid, solve the discretized
  equation with an ADI method at each grid level, with the solution from the
  previous grid level as the initial guess. The multilevel procedure stops as
  the ADI finishes its iterations on the finest grid. Analytical and
  experimental results show that the proposed method is highly accurate and
  efficient while remaining as algorithmically and data-structurally simple as
  the single grid ADI method. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
