  Key-value stores are being widely used as the storage system for large-scale
  internet services and cloud storage systems.

  However, they are rarely used in HPC systems, where parallel file systems are
  the dominant storage solution. In this

  study, we examine the architecture differences and performance characteristics
  of parallel file systems and key-value

  stores. We propose using key-value stores to optimize overall Input/Output
  (I/O) performance, especially for workloads

  that parallel file systems cannot handle well, such as the cases with intense
  data synchronization or heavy metadata oper-

  ations. We conducted experiments with several synthetic benchmarks, an I/O
  benchmark, and a real application. We

  modeled the performance of these two systems using collected data from our
  experiments, and we provide a predictive

  method to identify which system offers better I/O performance given a specific
  workload. The results show that we can

  optimize the I/O performance in HPC systems by utilizing key-value stores.
