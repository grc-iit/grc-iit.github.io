  Task scheduling is an integrated component of computing. With the emergence of
  Grid and

  ubiquitous computing, new challenges appear in task scheduling based on
  properties such as security,

  quality of service, and lack of central control within distributed
  administrative domains. A Grid task

  scheduling framework must be able to deal with these issues. One of the goals
  of Grid task scheduling

  is to achieve high system throughput while matching application needs with the
  available computing

  resources. This matching of resources in a non-deterministically shared
  heterogeneous environment

  leads to concerns over Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper we introduce a
  novel QoS guided task

  scheduling algorithm for Grid computing. Our novel algorithm is based on a
  general adaptive

  scheduling heuristics that includes QoS guidance. We evaluate our algorithm
  within a simulated Grid

  environment. These experimental results show that the new QoS guided Min-Min
  heuristic can lead to

  significant performance gain for a variety of applications. We compare our
  approach to others based

  on the quality of the prediction formulated by inaccurate information.
