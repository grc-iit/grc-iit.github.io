abstract: |-
  A major difficulty in restructuring compilation is
  how to compare parallel performance over a range of
  system and problem sizes. This study introduces the
  concept of range comparison for data-parallel program-
  ming. Unlike conventional execution time comparison
  in which performance is compared for a particular sys-
  tem and problem size, range comparison compares the
  performance of programs over a range of ensemble and
  problem sizes via scalability and performance crossing
  point analysis. An algorithm is developed to predict the
  crossing point automatically. The correctness of the
  algorithm is proved and a methodology is developed to
  integrate range comparison into restructuring compi-
  lations. A preliminary prototype of the methodology is
  implemented and tested under Vienna Fortran Compi-
  lation System. Experimental results demonstrate that
  range comparison is feasible and effective.
