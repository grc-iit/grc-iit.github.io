  Lack of effective performance-evaluation environments
  is a major barrier to the broader use of high perfor-
  mance computing. Conventional performance environ-
  ments are based on profiling and event instrumentation. It
  becomes problematic as parallel systems scale to hun-
  dreds of nodes and beyond. A framework of developing
  an integrated performance modeling and prediction sys-
  tem, SCALability Analyzer (SCALA), is presented in this
  study. In contrast to existing performance tools, the pro-
  gram performance model generated by SCALA is based
  on scalability analysis. SCALA assumes the availability
  of modern compiler technology, adopts statistical and
  symbolic methodologies, and has the support of browser
  interface. These technologies, together with a new ap-
  proach of scalability analysis, enable SCALA to provide
  the user with a more intuitive level of performance anal-
  ysis for scalable computing. A prototype SCALA system
  has been implemented. Initial experimental results show
  that SCALA is unique in its ability of revealing the scal-
  ing properties of a computing system.
