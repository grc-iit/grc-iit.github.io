  Traditionally, distributed storage systems have relied upon
  the interfaces provided by OS kernels to interact with stor-
  age hardware. However, much research has shown that OSes
  impose serious overheads on every I/O operation, especially
  on high-performance storage and networking hardware (e.g.,
  PMEM and 200GBe). Thus, distributed storage stacks are
  being re-designed to take advantage of this modern hard-
  ware by utilizing new hardware interfaces which bypass the
  kernel entirely. However, the impact of these optimizations
  have not been well-studied for real HPC workloads on real
  hardware. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evalua-
  tion of DAOS: a state-of-the-art distributed storage system
  which re-architects the storage stack from scratch for mod-
  ern hardware. We compare DAOS against traditional storage
  stacks and demonstrate that by utilizing optimal interfaces
  to hardware, performance improvements of up to 6x can be
  observed in real scientific applications.
