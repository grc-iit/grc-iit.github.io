  The low cost and availability of clusters of workstations have
  lead researchers to re-explore distributed computing using inde-
  pendent workstations. This approach may provide better cost/
  performance than tightly coupled multiprocessors. In practice,
  this approach often utilizes wasted cycles to run parallel jobs.
  In this paper we address the feasibility and limitation of such a
  nondedicated parallel processing environment assuming worksta-
  tion processes have priority over parallel tasks. We develop a sim-
  ple analytical model to predict parallel job response times. Our
  model provides insight into how significantly workstation owner
  interference degrades parallel program performance. It forms a
  foundation for task partitioning and scheduling in a nondedicated
  network environment. A new term, task ratio, which relates the
  parallel task demand to the mean service demand of nonparallel
  workstation processes, is introduced. We propose that task ra-
  tio is a useful metric for determining how a parallel applications
  should be partitioned and scheduled in order to make efficient
  use of a nondedicated distributed system.
