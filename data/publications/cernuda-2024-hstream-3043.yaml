abstract: |-
  Data streaming is gaining traction in high-performance computing
  (HPC) as a mechanism for continuous data transfer, but remains
  underutilized as a processing paradigm due to the inadequacy of
  existing technologies, which are primarily designed for cloud archi-
  tectures and ill-equipped to tackle HPC-specific challenges. This
  work introduces HStream, a novel data management design for
  out-of-core data streaming engines. Central to the HStream design
  is the separation of data and computing planes at the task level. By
  managing them independently, issues such as memory thrashing
  and back-pressure, caused by the high volume, velocity, and bursti-
  ness of I/O in HPC environments, can be effectively addressed at
  runtime. Specifically, HStream utilizes adaptive parallelism and hi-
  erarchical memory management, enabled by this design paradigm,
  to alleviate memory pressure and enhance system performance.
  These improvements enable HStream to match the performance of
  state-of-the-art HPC streaming engines and achieve up to a 1.5x
  reduction in latency under high data loads.
