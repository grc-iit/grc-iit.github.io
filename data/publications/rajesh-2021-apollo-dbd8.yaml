abstract: |-
  Applications and middleware services, such as data placement en-
  gines, I/O scheduling, and prefetching engines, require low-latency
  access to telemetry data in order to make optimal decisions. However,
  typical monitoring services store their telemetry data in a database
  in order to allow applications to query them, resulting in significant
  latency penalties. This work presents Apollo: a low-latency mon-
  itoring service that aims to provide applications and middleware
  libraries with direct access to relational telemetry data. Monitoring
  the system can create interference and overhead, slowing down raw
  performance of the resources for the job. However, having a current
  view of the system can aid middleware services in making more
  optimal decisions which can ultimately improve the overall perfor-
  mance. Apollo has been designed from the ground up to provide
  low latency, using Publishâ€“Subscribe (Pub-Sub) semantics, and low
  overhead, using adaptive intervals in order to change the length of
  time between polling the resource for telemetry data and machine
  learning in order to predict changes to the telemetry data between
  actual resource polling. This work also provides some high level
  abstractions called I/O curators, which can further aid middleware
  libraries and applications to make optimal decisions. Evaluations
  showcase that Apollo can achieve sub-millisecond latency for acquir-
  ing complex insights with a memory overhead of ~57MB and CPU
  overhead being only 7% more than existing state-of-the-art systems.
