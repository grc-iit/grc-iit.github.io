abstract: >-
  The road to 4G runs through 3G, 2G, and 2.5G networks. Until 3G is deployed

  ubiquitously, 2-2.5G networks and endpoints will dominate. Because of their

  widespread deployment and adoption, these endpoints can help ease the
  transition

  to an all-Internet 3G/4G network. We describe a standards-based service
  architec-

  ture and its implementation that allows 2-2.5G endpoints to participate as
  active

  actors in realizing Internet services like presence and instant messaging
  without the

  endpoints themselves being connected to the Internet. Our architecture also
  demon-

  strates service migration, wherein a successful 2G service such as short
  messaging

  service morphs transparently into its Internet equivalent, an instant message.
  Our

  methodology conserves precious radio access bandwidth by offloading such data

  services from the bandwidth normally allocated to voice. Our approach, as
  embod-

  ied in the service architecture, is to leverage the best of the Internet
  protocols (SIP,

  XML) and technologies (instant messaging, presence) to provide a general
  frame-

  work for personalized service specification and execution.
