  In this paper, we consider to improve scientific workflows in cloud
  environments where data transfers between tasks are

  performed via provisioned in-memory caching as a service, instead of relying
  entirely on slower disk-based file systems. However, this

  improvement is not free since services in the cloud are usually charged in a
  "pay-as-you-go" model. As a consequence, the workflow

  tenants have to estimate the amount of memory that they would like to pay.
  Given the intrinsic complexity of the workflows, it would be

  very hard to make an accurate prediction, which would lead to either
  oversubscription or undersubscription, resulting in unproductive

  spending or performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose a
  concept of minmax memory claim (MMC) to achieve

  cost-effective workflow computations in in-memory cloud computing
  environments. The minmax-memory claim is defined as the

  minimum amount of memory required to finish the workflow without compromising
  its maximum concurrency. With the concept of

  MMC, the workflow tenants can achieve the best performance via in-memory
  computing while minimizing the cost. In this paper, we

  present the procedure of how to find the MMCs for those workflows with
  arbitrary graphs in general and develop optimal efficient

  algorithms for some well-structured workflows in particular. To further show
  the values of this concept, we also implement these

  algorithms and apply them, through a simulation study, to improve deadlock
  resolutions in workflow-based workloads when memory

  resources are constrained.
