  In this paper three models of parallel speedup are studied. They
  are fixed-size speedup, fixed-time speedup, and memory-bounded
  speedup. The latter two consider the relationship between speedup
  and problem scalability. Two sets of speedup formulations are
  derived for these three models. One set considers uneven workload
  allocation and communication overhead and gives more accurate
  estimation. Another set considers a simplified case and provides a
  clear picture on the impact of the sequential portion of an applica-
  tion on the possible performance gain from parallel processing.
  The simplified fixed-size speedup is Amdahl's law. The simplified
  fixed-time speedup is Gustafson's scaled speedup. The simplified
  memory-bounded speedup contains both Amdahl's law and Gus-
  tafson's scaled speedup as special cases. This study leads to a
  better understanding of parallel processing.
