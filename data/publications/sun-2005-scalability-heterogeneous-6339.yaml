  Scalability is a key factor of the design of
  distributed systems and parallel algorithms and
  machines. However, conventional scalabilities are
  designed for homogeneous parallel processing. There
  is no suitable and commonly accepted definition of
  scalability metric for heterogeneous systems. Isospeed
  scalability is a well-defined metric for homogeneous
  computing. This study extends the isospeed scalability
  metric to general heterogeneous computing systems.
  The proposed isospeed-efficiency metric is suitable for
  both homogeneous and heterogeneous computing.
  Through theoretical analysis, we derive methodologies
  of scalability measurement and prediction for
  heterogeneous systems. Experimental results verify the
  analytical results and confirm that the proposed
  isospeed-efficiency scalability works well in both
  homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.
