  Checkpointing is widely used in technical computing.
  However, the overhead of checkpointing is a subject of
  increasing in concern in recent years, especially for large-scale
  parallel computer systems. In these systems, checkpointing
  generates a huge number of concurrent I/O writes. The burst
  of writes plus the worsening I/O-wall problem often leads to
  network and I/O congestion, and makes the overall system
  performance painfully slow. Recognizing contention as a
  dominant performance factor, in this paper we propose a
  systematic approach named checkpointing orchestration to
  reduce write contention, which combines the marshaling of
  concurrent checkpoint requests and the adopting of vertical
  data access in coordination. A prototype of the proposed
  checkpointing orchestration approach has been implemented
  at the system-level under Open MPI over the PVFS2 file
  system. Extensive experiments based on NPB benchmarks
  have been conducted to verify the design and implementation.
  Experimental results show that checkpointing orchestration
  reduced the checkpointing cost at a degree of more than 30%.
  Checkpointing cost was halved for 4 out of 5 the C class NPB
  benchmarks.
