abstract: |-
  Hybrid parallel file systems (PFS), which consist of both
  HDD and SSD servers, provide a promising solution for data-intensive
  applications. In this study, we propose a performance-aware data place-
  ment (PADP) strategy to enable efficient data layout in hybrid PFSs.
  The basic idea of PADP is to dispatch data on different file servers with
  adaptive varied-size file stripes based on the server storage performance.
  By using an effective data access cost model and a linear programming
  optimization method, the appropriate stripe sizes for each file server are
  determined effectively. We have implemented PADP within OrangeFS,
  a widely used parallel file system in HPC domain. Experimental results
  of representative benchmark show that PADP can significantly improve
  the I/O performance of hybrid PFSs.
