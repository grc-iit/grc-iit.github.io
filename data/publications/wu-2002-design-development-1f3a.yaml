  Debugging is an essential part of parallel and distributed processing.
  However, developing parallel and distributed debugger is

  difficult. This is especially true for cluster computing where heterogeneity
  presents. In this paper, we first give a survey of the current

  debugging techniques and existing tools, and then present a client-server
  debugging model. Based on this model, we discuss the design and

  development of a practical scalable distributed debugging system for cluster
  computing in detail, and give two case studies to show how

  the distributed debugging system efficiently supports debugging
  message-passing programs such as various MPI and PVM programs. The

  newly developed distributed debugger is based on the sequential debugger gdb
  and dbx. It has the capability of scaling to handle hundreds

  of processes. Its interfaces are completely implemented in Java, and its
  graphical user interface is the same on all computing platforms. In

  addition, it is portable, easy to learn and use.
