  As envisioned some seven years ago, the Next Generation Network (NGN) with its
  emphasis on

  ubiquitous services was to revolutionize the lives of its users. The NGN,
  resulting from the merger of

  telecommunications, Information Technology (IT) and the Internet would provide
  on-demand, always-on

  services to its users. Service providers were to be affected by the increase
  in revenues paid by the users

  of these new services. Equipment vendors would have a difficult time keeping
  inventories of the NGN

  infrastructure. The truth has been somewhat different. In this paper, we
  characterize a set of

  constraining forces and as well as some positive facilitating forces acting on
  the NGN.
