  Symmetric Toeplitz tridiagonal systems arise in many scientific applications.

  An efficient algorithm, the Simple Parallel Prefix (SPP) algorithm, was
  previously

  proposed for solving symmetric Toeplitz tridiagonal systems on SIMD and vector

  computers. Based on the SPP algorithm, a scalable parallel algorithm is
  proposed for

  solving periodic symmetric Toeplitz tridiagonal systems in this study. The
  newly

  proposed algorithm has the same parallel computation count as that of the SPP
  algorithm

  for non-periodic systems, and it requires only shift communication.
