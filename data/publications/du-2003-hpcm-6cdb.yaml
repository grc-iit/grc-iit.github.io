  Mobility is a fundamental functionality of the next
  generation internet computing. How to support mobility
  for legacy codes, however, is still an issue of research.
  The key to solve this outstanding issue is the support of
  heterogeneous process migration. During the last few
  years, we have successfully developed mechanisms to
  support heterogeneous process migration of legacy codes
  written in C, C++, and Fortran. We present in this paper
  the design of the High Performance Computing Mobility
  (HPCM) middleware,
  the
  development and
  implementation of its key components, pre-compiler and
  its static libraries. Due to the similarity between process
  migration and checkpointing, the pre-compiler not only
  makes automatic process migration of legacy codes
  feasible, but also supports dynamic heterogeneous
  checkpointing. We perform a set of tests and compare
  experimental results with Porch, a well-known portable
  heterogeneous checkpointing system. The experimental
  results show that our methods are feasible, efficient and
  very promising.
