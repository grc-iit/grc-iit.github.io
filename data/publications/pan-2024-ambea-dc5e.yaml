abstract: |-
  Maximal biclique enumeration (MBE) in bipartite
  graphs is a fundamental problem in data mining with widespread
  applications. Many recent works solve this problem based on the
  set-enumeration (SE) tree, which sequentially traverses vertices
  to generate the enumeration tree nodes representing distinct
  bicliques, then checks whether these bicliques are maximal or not.
  However, existing MBE algorithms only expand bicliques with
  untraversed vertices to ensure distinction, which often necessitate
  extensive node checks to eliminate non-maximal bicliques, result-
  ing in significant computational overhead during the enumeration
  process. To address this issue, we propose an aggressive set-
  enumeration (ASE) tree that aggressively expands all bicliques
  to their maximal form, thus avoiding costly node checks on
  non-maximal bicliques. This aggressive enumeration may pro-
  duce multiple duplicate maximal bicliques, but we efficiently
  eliminate these duplicates by leveraging the connection between
  parent and child nodes and conducting low-cost node checking.
  Additionally, we introduce an aggressive merge-based pruning
  (AMP) approach that aggressively merges vertices sharing the
  same local neighbors. This helps prune numerous duplicate
  node generations caused by subsets of merged vertices. We
  integrate the AMP approach into the ASE tree, and present the
  Aggressive Maximal Biclique Enumeration Algorithm (AMBEA).
  Experimental results show that AMBEA is 1.15× to 5.32× faster
  than its closest competitor and exhibits better scalability and
  parallelization capabilities on larger bipartite graphs.
