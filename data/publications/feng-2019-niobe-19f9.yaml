abstract: |-
  In the age of data-driven computing, integrating
  High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data (BD) en-
  vironments may be the key to increasing productivity and to
  driving scientific discovery forward. Scientific workflows consist
  of diverse applications (i.e., HPC simulations and BD analysis)
  each with distinct representations of data that introduce a se-
  mantic barrier between the two environments. To solve scientific
  problems at scale, accessing semantically different data from
  different storage resources is the biggest unsolved challenge. In
  this work, we aim to address a critical question: "How can we
  exploit the existing resources and efficiently provide transparent
  access to data from/to both environments". We propose iNtelligent
  I/O Bridging Engine (NIOBE), a new data integration framework
  that enables integrated data access for scientific workflows with
  asynchronous I/O and data aggregation. NIOBE performs the
  data integration using available I/O resources, in contrast to
  existing optimizations that ignore the I/O nodes present on the
  data path. In NIOBE, data access is optimized to consider both
  the ongoing production and the consumption of the data in
  the future. Experimental results show that with NIOBE, an
  integrated scientific workflow can be accelerated by up to 10x
  when compared to a no-integration baseline and by up to 133%
  compared to other state-of-the-art integration solutions.
