  Recent advances in latency hiding techniques have made performance evaluation
  of memory hierarchies a more difficult

  task. Applications compiled for a particular architecture may be executed on
  vastly different memory hierarchy implemen-

  tations. There is a need for performance analysis techniques that provide
  methods for understanding the interaction between

  applications and a given memory hierarchy. In this paper, we present a
  statistical approach to performance analysis of ad-

  vanced memory hierarchy implementations. The method involves the utilization
  of previously available statistical analysis

  techniques coupled with scalability analysis. The result is a novel step-wise
  approach to understanding the hierarchical mem-

  ory performance of scientific applications. We apply the method to several
  scientific applications of interest to the accelerated

  strategic computing initiative (ASCI) over the SGI machines PowerChallenge and
  Origin 2000. Results indicate some codes

  are statistically identical in memory performance, while others vary greatly.
  Furthermore, some codes do not take advantage

  of the performance enhancements to the memory system found in the Origin 2000.
