  We present a fourth order numerical solution method for the singular Neumann

  boundary problem of Poisson equations. Such problems arise in the solution
  process

  of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and in the time-harmonic wave
  propaga-

  tion in the frequence space with the zero wavenumber. The equation is first
  discretized

  with a fourth order modified Collatz difference scheme, producing a singular
  discrete

  equation. Then an efficient singular value decomposition (SVD) method modified

  from a fast Poisson solver is employed to project the discrete singular
  equation into

  the orthogonal complement of the null space of the singular matrix. In the
  comple-

  ment of the null space, the projected equation is uniquely solvable and its
  solution is

  proven to be a solution of the original singular discrete equation when the
  original

  equation has a solution. Analytical and experimental results show that this
  newly

  proposed singular equation solver is efficient while retaining the accuracy of
  the

  high order discretization.
