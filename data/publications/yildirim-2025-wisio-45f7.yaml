abstract: |-
  Modern HPC workloads involve large data transfers that can
  become bottlenecks. Existing analysis tools identify bottle-
  necks from per-file performance data but have limitations in
  parallelizability and rigid heuristic-based rules, necessitating
  an automated, efficient, and multi-perspective solution. We
  designed an automated tool, WisIO, that enables parallel
  and distributed analysis of multi-terabyte-scale workflow
  performance data. WisIO examines performance data from
  multiple perspectives, uses metric-driven bottleneck classifi-
  cation, and allows extensible mapping of bottlenecks to root
  causes. Experimental results demonstrate that WisIO's multi-
  perspective views substantially improve bottleneck coverage,
  showing an average increase of up to 805× when compared
  to analyzing performance data from a single perspective.
  In our performance evaluation, WisIO's metric-driven
  classification processed 340K bottlenecks per second, while
  its reasoning engine handled around 35K bottlenecks per sec-
  ond. In an analysis of five real-world HPC workloads, WisIO
  demonstrated up to 11× faster analysis time and identified
  up to 144x more bottlenecks compared to existing solutions.
