  Effective task scheduling and deployment is hard to achieve in a Grid
  environment, where computing resources are heterogamous and shared between
  local and Grid users without a central control. Current scheduling systems,
  such as AppLeS, use NWS (Network Weather Service) for short-term estimation of
  resource availability and do not address the influence of the variation of
  resource availability in task scheduling. These inherent limitations prevent
  existing scheduling systems from working effectively to solve large-scale
  tasks in a Grid environment. Adopting APST (AppLeS Parameter Sweep Template)
  as the deployment environment, we have developed a task scheduling system for
  large-scale applications based on our recent results in performance prediction
  and task scheduling. Preliminary experimental results show that the newly
  developed system works well and is significantly more appropriate for large
  applications than existing systems.
