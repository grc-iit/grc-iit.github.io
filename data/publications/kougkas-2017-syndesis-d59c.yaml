  The predominant data model in cloud storage is
  the object-based storage. Object stores follow a simpler API with
  get() and put() operations to interact with the data. A wide variety
  of data analysis software has been developed around objects
  using their APIs. In fact, the evolution of Big Data analytics is a
  major driver for highly optimized data-centric quality software.
  However, organizations maintain file-based storage clusters and a
  high volume of existing data are stored in files. This is specifically
  true for the scientific communities. In this paper, we present the
  key characteristics of object-based and file-based storage APIs,
  we explore several object-to-file mappings aiming to bridge the
  semantic gap between these data models. The evaluation of our
  mapping algorithms exposes various strengths and weaknesses
  of each strategy and frames the extended potential of a unified
  data access system. Results show that our solution can offer more
  than 3x higher performance for specific workloads while keeping
  minimal overhead of our library.
