  The collective communication operations, which
  are widely used in parallel applications for global commu-
  nication and synchronization are critical for application's
  performance and scalability. However, how faulty collective
  communications impact the application and how errors prop-
  agate between the application processes is largely unexplored.
  One of the critical reasons for this situation is the lack of fast
  evaluation method to investigate the impacts of faulty collective
  operations. The traditional random fault injection methods
  relying on a large amount of fault injection tests to ensure
  statistical significance require a significant amount of resources
  and time. These methods result in prohibitive evaluation cost
  when applied to the collectives.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel tool named Fast Fault
  Injection and Sensitivity Analysis Tool (FastFIT) to conduct
  fast fault injection and characterize the application sensitivity
  to faulty collectives. The tool achieves fast exploration by
  reducing the exploration space and predicting the application
  sensitivity using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. A basis
  for these techniques are implicit correlations between MPI
  semantics, application context, critical application features,
  and application responses to faulty collective communications.
  The experimental results show that our approach reduces
  the fault injection points and tests by 97% for represen-
  tative benchmarks (NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB)) and a
  realistic application (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively
  Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)) on a production supercomputer.
  Further, we statistically generalize the application sensitivity
  to faulty collective communications for these workloads, and
  present correlation between application features and the sen-
  sitivity.
