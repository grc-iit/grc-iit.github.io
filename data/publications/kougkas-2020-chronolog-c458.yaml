abstract: |-
  Modern applications produce and process massive
  amounts of activity (or log) data. Traditional storage systems
  were not designed with an append-only data model and a
  new storage abstraction aims to fill this gap: the distributed
  shared log store. However, existing solutions struggle to provide
  a scalable, parallel, and high-performance solution that can
  support a diverse set of conflicting log workload requirements.
  Finding the tail of a distributed log is a centralized point of
  contention. In this paper, we show how using physical time can
  help alleviate the need of centralized synchronization points. We
  present ChronoLog, a new, distributed, shared, and multi-tiered
  log store that can handle more than a million tail operations
  per second. Evaluation results show ChronoLog's potential,
  outperforming existing solution by an order of magnitude.
