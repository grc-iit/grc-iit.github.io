abstract: |-
  Computer networks exist to provide services to users. In
  domains where more then one network dominates and provides
  useful services, users will want to avail themselves of services on
  either of the networks. This paper looks at the convergence of two
  networks in the telecommunication domain: the Internet and the
  Public Switched Telephone Network and discusses techniques to
  access services between the two networks, including an
  architecture for realizing services which would not be possible if
  either of the networks was operating in isolation.
