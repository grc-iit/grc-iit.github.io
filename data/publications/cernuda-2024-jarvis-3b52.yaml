abstract: |-
  Hardware is becoming increasingly heterogeneous in
  modern high-performance computing clusters. However, computing
  environments for developing tools to harness these technologies are
  not easily available to researchers. This work showcases the need for
  a new high-pace, heterogeneous I/O research cluster and presents a
  novel software deployment framework named Jarvis to manage its
  hardware diversity. Jarvis is an extensible Python framework that
  allows users to create Packages that deploy, manage, and monitor
  software, including complex applications (e.g., scientific simulations),
  support tools (e.g., Darshan, GDB), and storage systems (e.g.,
  Lustre, DAOS). These packages can be combined to form complex
  deployment Pipelines. To ensure pipelines are portable across
  hardware, Jarvis defines a novel Resource Graph schema file,
  which is a snapshot of a cluster's machine-specific information.
  This schema can be queried by Jarvis packages to deploy software
  across diverse hardware compositions with minimal user effort.
