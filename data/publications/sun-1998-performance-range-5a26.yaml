  Parallel programming is elusive. The relative performance of different
  parallel implementations varies with machine architecture, system and
  problem size. How to compare different implementations over a wide
  range of machine architectures and problem sizes has never been well
  addressed due to its difficulty. Scalability has been proposed in recent
  years to reveal scaling properties of parallel algorithms and machines. In
  this paper, based on scalability analysis, the concepts of crossing point
  analysis and range comparison are introduced. Crossing point analysis
  finds slow/fast performance crossing points of parallel algorithms and
  machines. Range comparison compares performance over a wide range
  of ensemble and problem size via scalability and crossing point analysis.
  Three algorithms from scientific computing are implemented on an Intel
  Paragon and an IBM SP2 parallel computer. Experimental and theoret-
  ical results show the combination of scalability, crossing point analysis,
  and range comparison provides a practical solution for scalable perfor-
  mance evaluation. While our testings are conducted on homogeneous
  parallel computers, the proposed methodology applies to heterogeneous
  and network computing as well.
