abstract: |-
  Data prefetching technique is widely used to bridge the grow-
  ing performance gap between processor and memory. Nu-
  merous prefetching techniques have been proposed to exploit
  data patterns and correlations in the miss address stream.
  In general, the miss addresses are grouped by some common
  characteristics, such as program counter or memory region
  they belong to, into localized streams to improve prefetch
  accuracy and coverage. However, the existing stream lo-
  calization technique lacks the timing information of misses.
  This drawback can lead to a large fraction of untimely pre-
  fetches, which in turn limits the effectiveness of prefetching,
  wastes precious bandwidth and leads to high cache pollu-
  tion potentially. This paper proposes a novel mechanism
  named stream timing technique that can largely reduce un-
  timely prefetches and in turn increase the overall perfor-
  mance. Based on the proposed stream timing technique, we
  extend the conventional stride prefetcher and propose a new
  stride prefetcher called Time-Aware Stride (TAS) prefetch-
  er. We have carried out extensive simulation experiments to
  verify the design of the stream timing technique and the TAS
  prefetcher. The simulation results show that the proposed
  stream timing technique is promising in reducing untimely
  prefetches and the IPC improvement of TAS prefetcher out-
  performs the existing stride prefetcher by 11%.
