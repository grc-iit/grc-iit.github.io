  As parallel and distributed systems are evolving toward extreme scale, for
  example, high-performance

  computing systems involve millions of cores and billion-way parallelism, and
  high-capacity storage systems

  require efficient access to petabyte or exabyte of data, many new challenges
  are posed on designing and

  deploying next-generation interconnection communication networks in these
  systems. Fat-tree networks

  have been widely used in both data centers and high-performance computing
  (HPC) systems in the past

  decades and are promising candidates of the next-generation extreme-scale
  networks. In this article, we

  present FatTreeSim, a simulation framework that supports modeling and
  simulation of extreme-scale fat-

  tree networks with the goal of understanding the design constraints of
  next-generation HPC and distributed

  systems and aiding the design and performance optimization of the applications
  running on these systems.

  We have systematically experimented FatTreeSim on Emulab and Blue Gene/Q and
  analyzed the scalability

  and fidelity of FatTreeSim with various network configurations. On the Blue
  Gene/Q Mira, FatTreeSim can

  achieve a peak performance of 305 million events per second using 16,384
  cores. Finally, we have applied

  FatTreeSim to simulate several large-scale Hadoop YARN applications to
  demonstrate its usability.
