abstract: |-
  This paper presents a client-server debugging
  model, describes the design and implementation of a
  portable, scalable, practical distributed debugger based on
  this model, and compares it with the related work. The
  distributed debugger based on the sequential debugger
  gdb or dbx can efficiently support debugging various
  PVM and MPI programs, and its interfaces are
  implemented by Java. Therefore, it meets High
  Performance Debugging Standard's three general goals
  concerning parallel and distributed debuggers. In addition,
  it is portable, easy to learn and easy to use.
