abstract: |-
  We propose a general purpose service architecture for
  realizing services which start in the Public Switched Telephone
  Network (PSTN) but terminate and execute on the Internet. We
  discuss the needs for such services, our early research efforts in
  this direction which lead to prototyping certain benchmark ser-
  vices, and the current state of work in this area. We demonstrate
  the feasibility of the architecture by focusing on services which in-
  volve wireline PSTN as well as the wireless aspects (2 G, 2.5 G) of
  the PSTN. Our methodology is attractive since it keeps each of the
  domains (PSTN and Internet) unaware as to where the service is
  executing with respect to which domain actually requested the ser-
  vice. Individual entities participating in the service do not have any
  knowledge that external entities from another domain also con-
  tributed in the execution and fulfillment of such services. Our ap-
  proach, as embodied in the service architecture, is to leverage the
  best of the Internet protocols (SIP, XML, HTTP) and technologies
  (instant messaging, presence) to provide a general framework for
  personalized service specification and execution.
