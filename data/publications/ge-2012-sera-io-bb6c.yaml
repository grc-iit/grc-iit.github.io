  Improving energy efficiency is a primary concern
  in high performance computing system design. Because I/O
  accesses account for a large portion of the execution time
  for data intensive applications, energy-aware parallel I/O
  subsystems are critical for addressing challenges related to
  HPC energy efficiency. In this paper, we present an energy-
  conscious parallel I/O middleware approach that combines
  runtime I/O access interception and Dynamic Voltage and
  Frequency Scaling capability available on modern processors to
  intelligently schedule the system's power-performance mode for
  energy savings. We implement this approach into SERA-IO, an
  MPI-IO based middleware to enable energy consciousness for
  I/O intensive applications. Experimental evaluations conducted
  on real systems using multiple parallel I/O benchmarks show
  that SERA-IO can reduce system energy by 9% to 28% without
  decreasing application performance. With the emerging of
  large-scale data intensive applications and ever larger and
  more complex parallel computing systems, intelligent, energy
  conscious software and runtime systems such as SERA-IO are
  critical for the success of future high-end computing.
