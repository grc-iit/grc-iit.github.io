  The traditional definition of 'speedup' as the ratio of sequential execution
  time to parallel execution time has

  been widely accepted. One drawback to this metric is that it tends to reward
  slower processors and inefficient

  compilation with higher speedup. It seems unfair that the goals of high speed
  and high speedup are at odds with

  each other. In this paper, the 'fairness' of parallel performance metrics is
  studied. Theoretical and experimental

  results show that the most commonly used performance metric, parallel speedup,
  is 'unfair', in that it favors

  slow processors and poorly coded programs. Two new performance metrics are
  introduced. The first one, sizeup,

  provides a 'fair' performance measurement. The second one is a generalization
  of speedup â€“ the generalized

  speedup, which recognizes that speedup is the ratio of speeds, not times. The
  relation between sizeup, speedup,

  and generalized speedup are studied. The various metrics have been tested
  using a real application that runs on

  an nCUBE 2 multicomputer. The experimental results closely match the
  analytical results.
