abstract: |-
  Traditionally, I/O systems have been developed within
  the confines of a centralized OS kernel. This led to monolithic
  and rigid storage systems that are limited by low development
  speed, expressiveness, and performance. Various assumptions are
  imposed including reliance on the UNIX-file abstraction, the POSIX
  standard, and a narrow set of I/O policies. However, this monolithic
  design philosophy makes it difficult to develop and deploy new
  I/O approaches to satisfy the rapidly-evolving I/O requirements of
  modern scientific applications. To this end, we propose LabStor: a
  modular and extensible platform for developing high-performance,
  customized I/O stacks. Single-purpose I/O modules (e.g, I/O
  schedulers) can be developed in the comfort of userspace and released
  as plug-ins, while end-users can compose these modules to form
  workload- and hardware-specific I/O stacks. Evaluations show that
  by switching to a fully modular design, tailored I/O stacks can yield
  performance improvements of up to 60% in various applications.
