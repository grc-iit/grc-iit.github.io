  The underlying storage of hybrid parallel file systems (PFS) is composed of
  both SSD-based file servers (SServer) and HDD-based file servers (HServer).
  Unlike a traditional HServer, an SServer consistently provides improved
  storage performance but lacks storage space. However, most current data layout
  schemes do not consider the differences in performance and space between
  heterogeneous servers, and may significantly degrade the performance of the
  hybrid PFSs. In this paper, we propose PSA, a novel data layout scheme, which
  maximizes the hybrid PFSs performance by applying adaptive varied-size file
  stripes. PSA dispatches data on heterogeneous file servers not only based on
  storage performance but also storage space. We have implemented PSA within
  OrangeFS, a popular parallel file system in the HPC domain. Our extensive
  experiments using a representative benchmark show that PSA provides superior
  I/O throughput than the default and performance-aware file data layout
  schemes.
