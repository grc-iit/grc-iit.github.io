abstract: |-
  Most recent developments of computer sciences, such
  as web services, Grid, peer-to-peer, and mobile
  computing, are network-based computing. Their
  applicability depends on the availability of the underlying
  network bandwidth. However, network resources are
  shared and the available network bandwidth varies with
  time. There is no satisfactory solution available for
  network performance predictions. This lack of prediction
  limits the applicability of network-based computing,
  especially for Grid computing where concurrent remote
  processing is essential. In this study, we propose an
  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach for
  network performance prediction. The ANN mechanism
  has been tested on classical trace files and compared with
  the well-known system NWS (Network Weather Service)
  for performance. Experimental results show the ANN
  approach always provides an improved prediction over
  that of NWS. ANN has a real potential in network
  computing.
