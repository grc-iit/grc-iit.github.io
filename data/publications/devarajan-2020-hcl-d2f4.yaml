abstract: |-
  Most parallel programs use irregular control
  flow and data structures, which are perfect for one-sided
  communication paradigms such as MPI or PGAS programming
  languages. However, these environments lack the presence of
  efficient function-based application libraries that can utilize
  popular communication fabrics such as TCP, Infinity Band (IB),
  and RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE). Additionally,
  there is a lack of high-performance data structure interfaces. We
  present Hermes Container Library (HCL), a high-performance
  distributed data structures library that offers high-level
  abstractions including hash-maps, sets, and queues. HCL uses a
  RPC over RDMA technology that implements a novel procedural
  programming paradigm. In this paper, we argue a RPC over
  RDMA technology can serve as a high-performance, flexible,
  and co-ordination free backend for implementing complex data
  structures. Evaluation results from testing real workloads shows
  that HCL programs are 2x to 12x faster compared to BCL, a
  state-of-the-art distributed data structure library.
