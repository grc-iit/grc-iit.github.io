abstract: |-
  The combination of ever-growing scientific datasets
  and distributed workflow complexity creates I/O performance
  bottlenecks due to data volume, velocity, and variety. Although
  the increasing use of descriptive data formats (e.g., HDF5,
  netCDF) helps organize these datasets, it also introduces obscure
  bottlenecks due to the need to translate high-level operations
  into file addresses and then into low-level I/O operations. To
  address this challenge, we introduce DaYu, a method and toolset
  for analyzing (a) semantic relationships between logical datasets
  and file addresses, (b) how dataset operations translate into
  I/O, and (c) the combination across entire workflows. DaYu's
  analysis and visualization enable the identification of critical
  bottlenecks and the reasoning about remediation. We describe
  our methodology and propose optimization guidelines. Evaluation
  on scientific workflows demonstrates up to a 3.7x performance
  improvement in I/O time for obscure bottlenecks. The time and
  storage overhead for DaYu's time-ordered data are typically
  under 0.2% of runtime and 0.25% of data volume, respectively.
