abstract: |-
  To effectively model various regions with different
  resolutions, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is commonly
  used in cosmology simulations. There are two well-known
  numerical approaches towards the implementation of AMR-
  based cosmology simulations: block-based AMR and cell-based
  AMR. While many studies have been conducted to improve
  performance and scalability of block-structured AMR appli-
  cations, little work has been done for cell-based simulations.
  In this study, we present a parallel IO design for cell-based
  AMR cosmology applications, in particular, the ART(Adaptive
  Refinement Tree) code. First, we design a new data format that
  incorporates a space filling curve to map between spatial and
  on-disk locations. This indexing not only enables concurrent IO
  accesses from multiple application processes, but also allows
  users to extract local regions without significant additional
  memory, CPU or disk space overheads. Second, we develop a
  flexible N-M mapping mechanism to harvest the benefits of N-N
  and N-1 mappings where N is number of application processes
  and M is a user-tunable parameter for number of files. It not
  only overcomes the limited bandwidth issue of an N-1 mapping
  by allowing the creation of multiple files, but also enables users
  to efficiently restart the application at a variety of computing
  scales. Third, we develop a user-level library to transparently
  and automatically aggregate small IO accesses per process to
  accelerate IO performance. We evaluate this new parallel IO
  design by means of real cosmology simulations on production
  HPC system at TACC. Our preliminary results indicate that
  it can not only provide the functionality required by scientists
  (e.g., effective extraction of local regions and flexible process-to-
  file mapping), but also significantly improve IO performance.
