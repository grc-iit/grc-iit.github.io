  Understanding, characterizing and tuning scientific
  applications' I/O behavior is an increasingly complicated process
  in HPC systems. Existing tools use either offline profiling or
  online analysis to get insights into the applications' I/O patterns.
  However, there is lack of a clear formula to characterize applica-
  tions' I/O. Moreover, these tools are application specific and do
  not account for multi-tenant systems. This paper presents Vidya,
  an I/O profiling framework which can predict application's I/O
  intensity using a new formula called Code-Block I/O Character-
  ization (CIOC). Using CIOC, developers and system architects
  can tune an application's I/O behavior and better match the
  underlying storage system to maximize performance. Evaluation
  results show that Vidya can predict an application's I/O intensity
  with a variance of 0.05%. Vidya can profile applications with a
  high accuracy of 98% while reducing profiling time by 9x. We
  further show how Vidya can optimize an application's I/O time
  by 3.7x.
