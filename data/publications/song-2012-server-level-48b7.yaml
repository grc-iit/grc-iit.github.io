abstract: |-
  Parallel file systems are widely used for providing
  a high degree of I/O parallelism to mask the gap between I/O
  and memory speed. However, peak I/O performance is rarely
  attained due to complex data access patterns of applications.
  Based on the observation that the I/O performance of small
  requests is often limited by the request service rate, and the
  performance of large requests is limited by I/O bandwidth, we
  take into consideration both factors and propose a server-level
  adaptive data layout strategy. The proposed strategy adopts
  different stripe sizes for different file servers according to the
  data access characteristics on each individual server. We let
  the file servers that can fully utilize bandwidth hold more data,
  and the file servers that are limited with request service rate
  hold less data. As a result, heavy-load servers can offload some
  data accesses to light-load servers for potential improvement
  of I/O performance. We present a method to measure access
  cost for each data block and then utilize an equal-depth
  histogram approach to distributed data blocks across multiple
  servers adaptively, so as to balance data accesses on all file
  servers. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that
  the proposed server-level adaptive layout strategy can improve
  I/O performance by as much as 80.3% and is more appropriate
  for applications with complex data access patterns.
