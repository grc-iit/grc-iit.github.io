  With rapidly growing computing power, ultra
  high-resolution Earth science simulations with a long period of
  time are feasible. However, it is still very challenging to distribute
  and analyze a huge amount of simulation results, which could be
  over 100TB. One key reason is that typical Earth science data are
  represented in NetCDF, which is not supported by the popular
  and powerful Hadoop Distribute File System (HDFS) and
  consequently cannot be analyzed with tools based on HDFS. In
  this paper, we propose a Hadoop-based visualization and
  diagnosis framework for visualizing and analyzing Earth science
  data. It has a data model to transform data from the format of
  NetCDF to CSV (Comma Separated Value) that is supported by
  HDFS. With this model, data can be processed with the
  operations such as maximize, sum, and subset through HIVE and
  Cloudera Impala and, therefore, typical diagnoses can be
  performed. In addition, the framework has a technique to
  visualize and diagnose HDFS-resident data with the popular
  visualization and diagnosis tool, IDL. To speed up this process, a
  concurrent reader is developed to obtain HDFS-resident data.
  Moreover, a dynamic reader to transfer data from a parallel file
  system (PFS) to HDFS is developed to efficiently visualize and
  diagnose PFS-resident data. The cloud resolve mode simulations
  are used for testing and evaluating this framework.
