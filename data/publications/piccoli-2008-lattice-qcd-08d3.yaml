  This paper discusses the application of existing
  workflow management systems to a real world science
  application (LQCD). Typical workflows and execution
  environment used in production are described. Requirements
  for the LQCD production system are discussed. The workflow
  management systems Askalon and Swift were tested by
  implementing the LQCD workflows and evaluated against the
  requirements. We report our findings and future work.
