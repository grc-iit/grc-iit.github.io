  Recent technological advances are putting increased
  pressure on CPU scheduling. On one hand, processors have
  more cores. On the other hand, I/O systems have become more
  complex. Intensive research has been conducted on
  multi/many-core scheduling; however, most of the studies
  follow the conventional approach and focus on the utilization
  and load balance of the cores. In this study, we focus on
  increasing data locality by bringing source information from
  I/O into the core interrupt scheduling process. The premise is
  to group interrupts associated for the same I/O request
  together on the same core, and prove that data locality is more
  important than core utilization for many applications. Based
  on this idea, a source-aware affinity interrupt-scheduling
  scheme is introduced and a prototype system, SAIs, is
  implemented. Experiment results show that SAIs is feasible
  and promising; bandwidth shows a 23.57% improvement in a
  3-Gigabit NIC environment and in the optimal case without
  the NIC bottleneck, the bandwidth improvement increases to
  53.23%.
