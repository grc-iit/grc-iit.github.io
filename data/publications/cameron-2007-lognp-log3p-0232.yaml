  Many existing models of point-to-point communication in distributed systems
  ignore the impact of memory and middleware.

  Including such details may make these models impractical. Nonetheless, the
  growing gap between memory and CPU performance

  combined with the trend toward large-scale, clustered shared memory platforms
  implies an increased need to consider the impact of

  middleware on distributed communication. We present a general
  software-parameterized model of point-to-point communication for

  use in performance prediction and evaluation. We illustrate the utility of the
  model in three ways: 1) to derive a simplified, useful, more

  accurate model of point-to-point communication in clusters of SMPs, 2) to
  predict and analyze point-to-point and broadcast

  communication costs in clusters of SMPs, and 3) to express, compare, and
  contrast existing communication models. Though our

  methods are general, we present results on several Linux clusters to
  illustrate practical use on real systems.
