  Scalability is a crucial factor in performance
  evaluation and analysis of parallel and distributed
  systems. Much effort has been devoted to scalability
  research and several metrics are proposed. However,
  the lacking of an effective scalability analysis toolkit is
  still a major barrier for researchers to measure and
  analyze scalabilities. Isospeed scalability is a known
  metric and has been extended for general computing
  systems recently. This paper proposes an effective
  Scalability Testing and Analysis System, called STAS,
  and presents its implementation with isospeed-e
  scalability metric. STAS provides the facility to conduct
  automated isospeed-e scalability measure and analysis.
  It reduces the burden for users to evaluate the
  performance of algorithms and systems. Experiments
  have been conducted to verify the design and
  implementation.
