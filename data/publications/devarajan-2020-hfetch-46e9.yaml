abstract: |-
  In the era of data-intensive computing, accessing
  data with a high-throughput and low-latency is more imperative
  than ever. Data prefetching is a well-known technique for
  hiding read latency. However, existing solutions do not consider
  the new deep memory and storage hierarchy and also suffer
  from under-utilization of prefetching resources and unnecessary
  evictions. Additionally, existing approaches implement a client-
  pull model where understanding the application's I/O behavior
  drives prefetching decisions. Moving towards exascale, where
  machines run multiple applications concurrently by accessing
  files in a workflow, a more data-centric approach can resolve
  challenges such as cache pollution and redundancy. In this
  study, we present HFetch, a truly hierarchical data prefetcher
  that adopts a server-push approach to data prefetching. We
  demonstrate the benefits of such an approach. Results show 10-
  35% performance gains over existing prefetchers and over 50%
  when compared to systems with no prefetching.
