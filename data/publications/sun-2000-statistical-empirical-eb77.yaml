abstract: |-
  A hybrid approach that utilizes both statistical techniques
  and empirical methods seeks to provide more information about the per-
  formance of an application. In this paper, we present a general approach
  to creating hybrid models of this type. We show that for the scientific
  applications of interest, the scaled performance is somewhat predictable
  due to the regular characteristics of the measured codes. Furthermore,
  the resulting method encourages streamlined performance evaluation by
  determining which analysis steps may provide further insight to code
  performance.
