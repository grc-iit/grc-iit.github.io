  Key-Value Stores (KVStore) are being widely used
  as the storage system for large-scale Internet services and cloud
  storage systems. However, they are rarely used in HPC systems,
  where parallel file systems (PFS) are the dominant storage
  systems. In this study, we carefully examine the architecture
  difference and performance characteristics of PFS and KVStore.
  We propose that it is valuable to utilize KVStore to optimize
  the overall I/O performance, especially for the workloads that
  PFS cannot handle well, such as the cases with hurtful data
  synchronization or heavy metadata operations. To verify this
  proposal, we conducted comprehensive experiments with several
  synthetic benchmarks, an I/O benchmark, and a real application.
  The results show that our proposal is promising.
