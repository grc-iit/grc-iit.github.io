abstract: |-
  Persistent memory (PMEM) devices can achieve
  comparable performance to DRAM while providing significantly
  more capacity. This has made the technology compelling as
  an expansion to main memory. Rethinking PMEM as storage
  devices can offer a high performance buffering layer for HPC
  applications to temporarily, but safely store data. However,
  modern parallel I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and pNetCDF, are
  complicated and introduce significant software and metadata
  overheads when persisting data to these storage devices, wasting
  much of their potential. In this work, we explore the potential
  of PMEM as storage through pMEMCPY: a simple, lightweight,
  and portable I/O library for storing data in persistent memory.
  We demonstrate that our approach is up to 2x faster than other
  popular parallel I/O libraries under real workloads.
