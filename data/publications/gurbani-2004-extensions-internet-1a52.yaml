abstract: |-
  We discuss extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) to enable a rich set of services between the cellular Public
  Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the Internet. We consider
  all manner of cellular endpoints: 2G, 2.5G, and early 3G endpoints.
  These extensions allow the PSTN endpoints to act as smart SIP user
  agents and participate in Internet-oriented services such as presence
  and instant messaging (IM) without the endpoint itself being
  connected to the Internet. For cellular networks, our methodology
  conserves precious radio spectrum by offloading such data services
  from the bandwidth normally allocated to voice. Our approach is
  based on open standards and is not an ad-hoc or incremental solution.
