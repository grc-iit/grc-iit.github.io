  Parallel applications can benefit greatly from mas-
  sive computational capability, but their performance
  suffers from large latency of I/O accesses. The poor
  I/O performance has been attributed as a critical
  cause of the low sustained performance of paral-
  lel computing systems. In this study, we propose a
  data layout-aware optimization strategy to promote
  a better integration of the parallel I/O middleware
  and parallel file systems, two major components of
  the current parallel I/O systems, and to improve the
  data access performance. We explore the layout-aware
  optimization in both independent I/O and collective
  I/O, two primary forms of I/O in parallel applications.
  We illustrate that the layout-aware I/O optimization
  could improve the performance of current parallel
  I/O strategy effectively. The experimental results verify
  that the proposed strategy could improve parallel I/O
  performance by nearly 40% on average. The proposed
  layout-aware parallel I/O has a promising potential in
  improving the I/O performance of parallel systems.
