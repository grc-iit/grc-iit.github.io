abstract: |-
  Group communications are commonly used in
  parallel and distributed environment. However,
  existing migration mechanisms do not support group
  communications. This weakness prevents migration-
  based proactive fault tolerance, among others, to be
  applied to MPI applications. In this study, we propose
  distributed migration protocols with
  group
  membership management to support process migration
  with group changing. We design and implement a
  process migration enabling MPI library, named MPI-
  Mitten, to verify the protocols and enhance current
  MPI platforms for reliability and usability. MPI-Mitten
  is based on MPI standard and can be applied to any
  MPI-2 implementations. Experimental results show the
  proposed distributed process migration protocols are
  solid and the MPI-Mitten system is effective and is
  uniquely supporting migration-based fault tolerance.
