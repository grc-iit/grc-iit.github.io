abstract: |-
  Fat-tree topologies have been widely adopted as the commu-
  nication network in data centers in the past decade. Nowa-
  days, high-performance computing (HPC) system designers
  are considering using fat-tree as the interconnection network
  for the next generation supercomputers. For extreme-scale
  computing systems like the data centers and supercomput-
  ers, the performance is highly dependent on the intercon-
  nection networks. In this paper, we present Fat TreeSim, a
  PDES-based toolkit consisting of a highly scalable fat-tree
  network model, with the goal of better understanding the de-
  sign constraints of fat-tree networking architectures in data
  centers and HPC systems, as well as evaluating the applica-
  tions running on top of the network. Fat TreeSim is designed
  to model and simulate large-scale fat-tree networks up to
  millions of nodes with protocol-level fidelity. We have con-
  ducted extensive experiments to validate and demonstrate
  the accuracy, scalability and usability of Fat TreeSim. On
  Argonne Leadership Computing Facility's Blue Gene/Qsys-
  tem, Mira, Fat TreeSim is capable of achieving a peak event
  rate of 305 M/s for a 524,288-node fat-tree model with a
  total of 567 billion committed events. The strong scaling
  experiments use up to 32,768 cores and show a near linear
  scalability. Comparing with a small-scale physical system
  in Emulab, Fat TreeSim can accurately model the latency in
  the same fat-tree network with less than 10% error rate for
  most cases. Finally, we demonstrate Fat TreeSim's usability
  through a case study in which Fat TreeSim serves as the net-
  work module of the YARNsim system, and the error rates
  for all test cases are less than 13.7%.
