  Intensive research has been conducted on dynamic job
  scheduling, which dynamically allocates jobs to
  computing systems. However, most of the existing work is
  limited to redistribute independent tasks or at the
  algorithm design level. There is no runtime system
  available to support automatic redistribution of a running
  process in a heterogeneous network environment. In this
  study, we present the design and implementation of a
  system that dynamically reschedules running processes
  over a network of computing resources via automatic
  decision-making and process migration. The system is
  implemented on top of MPI-2 and HPCM (High
  Performance Computing Mobility) middleware.
  Experimental and analytical results show that the runtime
  system works well. It makes dynamic rescheduling of
  running tasks possible and improves system performance
  considerably. While the implementation is for MPI
  programs and using HPCM, the design of the system is
  general and can be extended to other distributed
  environments as well.
