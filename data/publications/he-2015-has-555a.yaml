abstract: |-
  Hybrid parallel file systems (PFS), consisting of
  multiple HDD and SSD I/O servers, provide a promising design
  for data intensive applications. The efficiency of a hybrid PFS
  relies on the file's data layout. However, most current layout
  strategies are designed and optimized for homogeneous servers.
  Using them directly in a hybrid PFS neither addresses the
  heterogeneity of servers nor the varying access patterns of
  applications, making hybrid PFSs disappointingly inefficient.
  In this paper, we propose HAS, a novel heterogeneity-aware
  selective data layout scheme for hybrid PFSS. HAS alleviates the
  inter-server load imbalance through skewing data distribution
  on heterogeneous servers based on their storage performance. To
  largely improve the entire system's I/O efficiency, HAS adaptively
  selects the optimal data layout from three typical candidates
  according to the application's data access patterns, based on
  a newly developed selection and distribution algorithm. We
  have implemented HAS within OrangeFS to provide efficient
  data distribution for data-intensive applications. Our extensive
  experiments validate that HAS significantly increases the I/O
  throughput of hybrid PFSs, compared to existing data layout
  optimization methods.
