  Due to the infamous "memory wall" problem and a drastic increase in the number
  of data intensive applications, memory rather

  than processors has become the leading performance bottleneck in modern
  computing systems. Evaluating and understanding memory

  system performance is increasingly becoming the core of high-end computing.
  Conventional memory metrics, such as miss ratio, AMAT,

  etc., are designed to measure a given memory performance parameter, and do not
  reflect the overall performance or complexity of a

  modern memory system. On the other hand, widely used system-performance
  metrics, such as IPC, are designed to measure CPU

  performance, and do not directly reflect memory performance. In this paper, we
  propose a novel memory metric called Access Per Cycle

  (APC), which is the number of data accesses per cycle, to measure the overall
  memory performance with respect to the complexity of

  modern memory systems. A unique contribution of APC is its separation of
  memory evaluation from CPU evaluation; therefore, it provides

  a quantitative measurement of the "data-intensiveness" of an application.
  Simulation results show that the memory performance measured

  by APC captures the concurrency complexity of modern memory systems, while
  other metrics cannot. APC is simple, effective, and is

  significantly more appropriate than existing memory metrics in evaluating
  modern memory systems.
