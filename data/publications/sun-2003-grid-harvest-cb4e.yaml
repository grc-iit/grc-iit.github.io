abstract: |-
  With the emergence of grid computing environment,
  performance measurement, analysis and prediction of
  non-dedicated distributed systems have become
  increasingly important. In this study, we put forward a
  novel performance model for non-dedicated network
  computing. Based on this model, a performance prediction
  and task scheduling system called Grid Harvest Service
  (GHS), has been designed and implemented. GHS consists
  of a performance measurement component, a prediction
  component and a scheduling component. Different
  scheduling algorithms are proposed for different
  situations. Experimental results show that the GHS system
  provides satisfactory solution for performance prediction
  and scheduling of large applications and that GHS has a
  real potential.
  Keywords: performance prediction and measurement,
