abstract: |-
  Despite the popularity of the Apache Hadoop
  system, its success has been limited by issues such as single points
  of failure, centralized job/task management, and lack of support
  for programming models other than MapReduce. The next
  generation of Hadoop, Apache Hadoop YARN, is designed to
  address these issues. In this paper, we propose YARNsim, a
  simulation system for Hadoop YARN. YARNsim is based on
  parallel discrete event simulation and provides protocol-level
  accuracy in simulating key components of YARN. YARNsim
  provides a virtual platform on which system architects can
  evaluate the design and implementation of Hadoop YARN
  systems. Also, application developers can tune job performance
  and understand the tradeoffs between different configurations,
  and Hadoop YARN system vendors can evaluate system
  efficiency under limited budgets.
  To demonstrate the validity of YARNsim, we use it to model
  two real systems and compare the experimental results from
  YARNsim and the real systems. The experiments include
  standard Hadoop benchmarks, synthetic workloads, and a
  bioinformatics application. The results show that the error rate is
  within 10% for the majority of test cases. The experiments prove
  that YARNsim can provide what-if analysis for system designers
  in a timely manner and at minimal cost compared with testing
  and evaluating on a real system.
