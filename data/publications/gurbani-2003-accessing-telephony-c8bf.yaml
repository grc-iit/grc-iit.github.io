abstract: |-
  Networks exist to provide services to users.
  Increasingly, the networks on which the services reside are not
  the same as the networks from which the services are accessed.
  This leads to the problem on how to best provide such services
  transparently when the access protocols differ. We discusses a
  methodology to make available the existing services residing in a
  network whose protocols are distinct from the network where the
  access attempt is made. We propose a technique we term call
  model mapping with state sharing and demonstrate it in the
  telecommunication domain where we access traditional telephony
  services residing on the telephone network from Internet
  telephony endpoints residing on the Internet.
