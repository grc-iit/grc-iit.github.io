  As DRAM is a considerably slow storage compared
  to CPU, the long access latency becomes a serious issue and
  affects the whole execution if fetching data is on the critical
  path. It is benefical if the data layout on DRAM, which is
  decided by address mapping, can serve data accesses with either
  great locality or bank-level parallelism. However for some cases,
  there exists a huge mismatch between access patterns and data
  layout of applications, which introduces the difficulty in obtaining
  locality or parallelism and current general address mapping
  cannot resolve it well.
  In an effort to overcome this challenge, we present an self-
  adaptive address mapping mechanism in memory controller to
  be aware of different access patterns on DRAM without any
  prior knowledge of applications. Moreover, there is nearly no
  modification on softwares, including applications, libraries and
  OS. We take several versions of matrix multiplication as an early
  verification, since their patterns are regular and simple to control.
  Impressively, the results reveal that memory performance of naive
  and tiling versions is improved up to 3.4x and 2.7x at most,
  2.1x and 1.7x on average respectively. The whole execution time
  is reduced by up to 24% and 8% averagely. Even for highly-
  optimized implementations, execution time is decreased by 7%
  and memory performance speeds up to 1.6x on average.
