  Modern schedulers running on HPC systems tradi-
  tionally consider the number of resources and the time requested
  for each job that is to be executed when making scheduling
  decisions. Until recently this has been sufficient, however as
  systems get larger, other metrics like power consumption become
  necessary to ensure system stability.
  In this paper, we propose a data driven scheduling approach
  for controlling the power consumption of the entire system under
  any user defined budget. Here, "data driven" means that our ap-
  proach actively observes, analyzes, and assesses power behaviors
  of the system and user jobs to guide scheduling decisions for
  power management. This design is based on the key observation
  that HPC jobs have distinct power profiles. Our work contains
  an empirical analysis of workload power characteristics on a
  production system, dynamic learner to estimate the job power
  profile for scheduling, and an online power-aware scheduler for
  managing the overall system power. Using real workload traces,
  we demonstrate that our design effectively controls system power
  consumption while minimizing the impact on system utilization.
