abstract: |-
  Data prefetching is an effective way to bridge the increasing
  performance gap between processor and memory. As computing
  power is increasing much faster than memory performance, we
  suggest that it is time to have a dedicated cache to store data access
  histories and to serve prefetching to mask data access latency
  effectively. We thus propose a new cache structure, named Data
  Access History Cache (DAHC), and study its associated
  prefetching mechanisms. The DAHC behaves as a cache for recent
  reference information instead of as a traditional cache for
  instructions or data. Theoretically, it is capable of supporting many
  well known history-based prefetching algorithms, especially
  adaptive and aggressive approaches. We have carried out
  simulation experiments to validate DAHC design and
  DAHC-based data prefetching methodologies and to demonstrate
  performance gains. The DAHC provides a practical approach to
  reaping data prefetching benefits and its associated prefetching
  mechanisms are proven more effective than traditional approaches.
