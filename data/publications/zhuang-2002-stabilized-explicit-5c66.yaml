  We report a class of stabilized explicit-implicit domain decomposition (SEIDD)

  methods for the numerical solution of parabolic equations. Explicit-implicit
  domain decomposition

  (EIDD) methods are globally noniterative, nonoverlapping domain decomposition
  methods, which,

  when compared with Schwarz-algorithm-based parabolic solvers, are
  computationally and commu-

  nicationally efficient for each simulation time step but suffer from small
  time step size restrictions.

  By adding a stabilization step to EIDD, the SEIDD methods retain the
  time-stepwise efficiency in

  computation and communication of the EIDD methods but exhibit much better
  numerical stability.

  Three SEIDD algorithms are presented in this paper, which are experimentally
  tested to show excel-

  lent stability, computation and communication efficiencies, and high parallel
  speedup and scalability.
