abstract: |-
  The applicability of network-based computing
  depends on the availability of the underlying network
  bandwidth. However, network resources are shared
  and the available network bandwidth varies with time.
  There is no satisfactory solution available for network
  performance predictions. In this research, we propose,
  design, and implement the NBP (Network Bandwidth
  Predictor) for rapid network performance prediction.
  NBP is a new system that employs a neural network
  based approach for network bandwidth forecasting.
  This system is designed to integrate with most
  advanced technologies. It employs the NWS (Network
  Weather Service) monitoring subsystem to measure the
  network traffic, and provides an improved, more
  accurate performance prediction than that of NWS,
  especially with applications with a network usage
  pattern. The NBP system has been tested on real time
  data collected by NWS monitoring subsystem and on
  trace files. Experimental results confirm that NBP has
  an improved prediction.
