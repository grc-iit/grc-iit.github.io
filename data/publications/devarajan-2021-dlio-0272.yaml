abstract: |-
  Deep learning has been shown as a successful
  method for various tasks, and its popularity results in numerous
  open-source deep learning software tools. Deep learning has
  been applied to a broad spectrum of scientific domains such
  as cosmology, particle physics, computer vision, fusion, and
  astrophysics. Scientists have performed a great deal of work
  to optimize the computational performance of deep learning
  frameworks. However, the same cannot be said for I/O perfor-
  mance. As deep learning algorithms rely on big-data volume and
  variety to effectively train neural networks accurately, I/O is
  a significant bottleneck on large-scale distributed deep learning
  training. This study aims to provide a detailed investigation of
  the I/O behavior of various scientific deep learning workloads
  running on the Theta supercomputer at Argonne Leadership
  Computing Facility. In this paper, we present DLIO, a novel
  representative benchmark suite built based on the I/O profiling
  of the selected workloads. DLIO can be utilized to accurately
  emulate the I/O behavior of modern scientific deep learning
  applications. Using DLIO, application developers and system
  software solution architects can identify potential I/O bottlenecks
  in their applications and guide optimizations to boost the I/O
  performance leading to lower training times by up to 6.7x.
