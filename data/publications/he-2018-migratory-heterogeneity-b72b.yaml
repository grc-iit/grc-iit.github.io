abstract: |-
  Parallel file systems (PFSs) are widely deployed to
  speed up the performance of high-performance computing (HPC)
  applications. In recent years, hybrid PFSs that consist of HDD-
  SSD servers, have attracted much attention in HPC community.
  However, existing data layout schemes do not well consider
  the characteristics of heterogeneous servers and heterogeneous
  access patterns, thus may experience considerable inefficiencies.
  In this study, we propose MHA, a migratory heterogeneity-aware
  data layout scheme to improve the data distribution of hybrid
  PFS. More specifically, to accommodate heterogeneous access
  patterns, MHA first migrates file data into several regions, each
  with similar access patterns. Then, by leveraging a data access
  cost model, MHA determines the appropriate stripe sizes on
  heterogeneous servers to get the best performance on each region.
  We have implemented MHA under MPI-IO library on top of
  OrangeFS file system. Experimental results show that MHA can
  significantly improve the hybrid PFS I/O system performance
  compared to existing data layout schemes.
