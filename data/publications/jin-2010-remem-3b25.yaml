abstract: |-
  Checkpointing is a widely used mechanism for
  supporting fault tolerance, but notorious in its high-cost disk
  access. The idea of memory-based checkpointing has been
  extensively studied in research but made little success in
  practice due to its complexity and potential reliability concerns.
  In this study we present the design and implementation of
  REMEM, a REmote MEMory checkpointing system to extend
  the checkpointing storage from disk to remote memory. A
  unique feature of REMEM is that it can be integrated into
  existing disk-based checkpointing systems seamlessly. A user
  can flexibly switch between REMEM and disk as checkpointing
  storage to balance the efficiency and reliability. The imple-
  mentation of REMEM on Open MPI is also introduced. The
  experimental results confirm that REMEM and the proposed
  adaptive checkpointing storage selection are promising in both
  performance, reliability and scalability.
