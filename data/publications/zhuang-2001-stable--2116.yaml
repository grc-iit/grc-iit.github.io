  In this paper, we report a class of stabilized explicit-implicit domain
  decomposition (SEIDD)

  methods for the parallel solution of parabolic equations, based on the
  explicit-implicit domain

  decomposition (EIDD) methods. EIDD methods are globally non-iterative,
  non-overlapping

  domain decomposition methods which, when compared with Schwarz alternating
  algorithm

  based parabolic solvers, are computationally and communicationally efficient
  for each sim-

  ulation time step but suffer from time step size restrictions due to
  conditional stability or

  conditional consistency. By adding a stabilization step to the EIDD methods,
  the SEIDD

  methods are freed from time step size restrictions while retaining EIDD's
  computational and

  communicational efficiency for each time step, rendering them excellent
  candidates for large-

  scale parallel simulations. Three algorithms of the SEIDD type are
  implemented, which are

  experimentally tested to show excellent stability, computation and
  communication efficien-

  cies, and high parallel speedup and scalability.
