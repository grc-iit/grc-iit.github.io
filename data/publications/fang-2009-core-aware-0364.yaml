abstract: |-
  Multi-core processors have changed the
  conventional hardware structure and require a
  rethinking of system scheduling and resource
  management to utilize them efficiently. However,
  current multi-core systems are still using conventional
  single-core memory scheduling. In this study, we
  investigate and evaluate traditional memory access
  scheduling techniques, and propose a core-aware
  memory scheduling for multi-core environments. Since
  memory requests from the same source exhibit better
  locality, it is reasonable to schedule the requests by
  taking the source of the requests into consideration.
  Motivated from this principle of locality, we propose
  two core-aware policies based on traditional bank-first
  and row-first schemes. Simulation results show that the
  core-aware policies can effectively improve the
  performance. Compared with the bank-first and
  row-first policies, the proposed core-aware policies
  reduce the execution time of certain NAS Parallel
  Benchmarks by up to 20% in running the benchmarks
  separately, and by 11% in running them concurrently.
