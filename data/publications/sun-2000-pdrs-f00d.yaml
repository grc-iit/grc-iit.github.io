  We present the design and development of a Performance Data

  Representation System (PDRS) for scalable parallel computing. PDRS provides

  decision support that helps users find the right data to understand their
  programs'

  performance and to select appropriate ways to display and analyze it. PDRS is
  an

  attempt to provide appropriate assistant to help programmers identifying

  performance bottlenecks and optimizing their programs.
