  While computing speed continues increasing
  rapidly, data-access technology is lagging behind. Data-access
  delay, not the processor speed, becomes the leading
  performance bottleneck of high-end/high-performance
  computing. Prefetching is an effective solution to masking the
  gap between computing speed and data-access speed. Existing
  works of prefetching, however, are very conservative in
  general, due to the computing power consumption concern of
  the past. They suffer in effectiveness especially when
  applications' access pattern changes. In this study, we propose
  an Algorithm-level Feedback-controlled Adaptive (AFA) data
  prefetcher to address these issues. The AFA prefetcher is based
  on the Data-Access History Cache, a hardware structure that is
  specifically designed for data prefetching. It provides an
  algorithm-level adaptation and is capable of dynamically
  adapting to appropriate prefetching algorithms at runtime. We
  have conducted extensive simulation testing with SimpleScalar
  simulator to validate the design and to illustrate the
  performance gain. The simulation results show that AFA
  prefetcher is effective and achieves considerable IPC
  (Instructions Per Cycle) improvement in average.
