  The concept of co-allocation provides a simple mechanism to request and bind
  resources in a coordinated fashion in Grids across virtual organization
  boundaries. We have designed an advanced multistage co-allocation strategy
  based on resource hierarchies defined through user-specific patterns. The
  model manages simple flows between resources to perform managed job
  executions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model on several examples and
  discuss advantages and disadvantages of the model.
