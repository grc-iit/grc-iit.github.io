  Multi-tiered Parallel I/O systems that combine traditional HDDs with emerging
  SSDs mitigate the cost burden of SSDs while

  benefiting from their superior I/O performance. While a multi-tiered parallel
  I/O system is promising for data-intensive applications in

  high-performance (HPC) domains, placing data on each tier of the system to
  achieve high I/O performance remains a challenge. In

  this paper, we propose a cost-aware region-level (CARL) data placement scheme
  in multi-tiered parallel I/O systems. CARL divides

  a large file into several small regions, and then places regions on different
  types of servers based on region access costs. CARL

  includes a static policy S-CARL and a dynamic policy D-CARL. For applications
  whose I/O access patterns are completely known,

  S-CARL calculates the region costs within the entire workload duration, and
  uses a static data placement scheme to selectively place

  regions on the proper servers. To adapt to applications whose access patterns
  are unknown in advance, D-CARL uses a dynamic data

  placement scheme which migrates data among different servers within each time
  window. We have implemented CARL under MPI-IO

  library and OrangeFS parallel file system environment. Our evaluation with
  representative benchmarks and an application shows that

  CARL is both feasible and able to improve I/O performance significantly.
