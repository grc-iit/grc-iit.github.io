  As the performance gap between processors and storage devices keeps
  increasing, I/O performance becomes a

  critical bottleneck of modern high-performance computing systems. In this
  paper, we propose a pattern-directed and layout-aware

  data replication design, named PDLA, to improve the performance of parallel
  I/O systems. PDLA includes an HDD-based scheme

  H-PDLA and an SSD-based scheme S-PDLA. For applications with relatively low
  I/O concurrency, H-PDLA identifies access patterns

  of applications and makes a reorganized data replica for each access pattern
  on HDD-based servers with an optimized data layout.

  Moreover, to accommodate applications with high I/O concurrency, S-PDLA
  replicates critical access patterns that can bring

  performance benefits on SSD-based servers or on HDD-based and SSD-based
  servers. We have implemented the proposed

  replication scheme under MPICH2 library on top of OrangeFS file system.
  Experimental results show that H-PDLA can significantly

  improve the original parallel I/O system performance and demonstrate the
  advantages of S-PDLA over H-PDLA.
