abstract: |-
  Data prefetching has been considered an effective
  way to mask data access latency caused by cache
  misses and to bridge the performance gap between
  processor and memory. With hardware and/or
  software support, data prefetching brings data closer
  to a processor before it is actually needed. Many
  prefetching techniques have been proposed in the last
  few years to reduce data access latency by taking
  advantage of multi-core architectures. In this paper,
  we propose a taxonomy that classifies various design
  concerns in developing a prefetching strategy. We
  discuss various prefetching strategies and issues that
  have to be considered in designing a prefetching
  strategy for multi-core processors.
