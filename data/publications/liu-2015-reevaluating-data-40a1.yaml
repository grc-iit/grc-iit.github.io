  Data access delay has become the prominent performance bottleneck of high-end
  computing systems. The key

  to reducing data access delay in system design is to diminish data stall time.
  Memory locality and concurrency are the two

  essential factors influencing the performance of modern memory systems.
  However, existing studies in reducing data stall

  time rarely focus on utilizing data access concurrency because the impact of
  memory concurrency on overall memory system

  performance is not well understood. In this study, a pair of novel data stall
  time models, the L-C model for the combined

  effort of locality and concurrency and the P-M model for the effect of pure
  miss on data stall time, are presented. The

  models provide a new understanding of data access delay and provide new
  directions for performance optimization. Based

  on these new models, a summary table of advanced cache optimizations is
  presented. It has 38 entries contributed by data

  concurrency while only has 21 entries contributed by data locality, which
  shows the value of data concurrency. The L-C and

  P-M models and their associated results and opportunities introduced in this
  study are important and necessary for future

  data-centric architecture and algorithm design of modern computing systems.
