abstract: |-
  The performance gap between processor and stor-
  age device has continuously increased during the past few
  decades. The gap is further exacerbated recently because appli-
  cations are becoming more data-intensive in both industry and
  academia. Traditional storage devices, such as hard disk drives
  (HDD), fail to keep up with the paces of this growth. A known
  solution is to use solid state drives (SSD) as fast storage. Due to
  high cost of SSD, data and supercomputing centers usually adopt
  a hybrid storage system, which consists of a combination of HDD
  and SSD I/O servers. However, hybrid I/O and storage systems
  have increased the complexity, making SSD often underutilized.
  The configuration and utilization of HDD/SSD hybrid systems is a
  lasting phenomenon. In this study, we propose a high performance
  hybrid parallel I/O and storage simulator, HPIS3. As a co-design
  tool, HPIS3 is capable of simulating a variety of parallel storage
  systems, especially under hybrid scenarios. The experimental
  results show that the lowest error rate is 2%, and the average is
  11.98%.
