abstract: |-
  Resource sharing across different computers and
  organizations makes it possible to support diverse,
  dynamic changing resource requirements of distributed
  applications. Reservation mechanisms have been used
  to reserve resources for external applications through
  service level agreements between local resource
  organizations and external applications. However, the
  effects of resource reservation on local applications,
  and therefore the trustfulness of the successful
  fulfillment of the service agreement, have been
  ignored. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
  resource reservation on external applications as well
  as local jobs, and design efficient task scheduling
  algorithms considering the tolerance of local jobs to
  resource reservation. Extensive simulations and
  implementation experiments have been carried out to
  confirm our analysis results. Experimental results
  show that the relative slowdown metric and the failure-
  minimization scheduling algorithms proposed in this
  study are practically effective and have a real
  potential.
