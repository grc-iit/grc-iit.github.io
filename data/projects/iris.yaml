title: 'IRIS: I/O Redirection Via Integrated Storage'
shortDescription: >-
  Various storage solutions exist and require specialized APIs and data models in order to use, which binds developers,
  applications, and entire computing facilities to using certain interfaces. Each storage system is designed and
  optimized for certain applications but does not perform well for others. IRIS is a unified storage access system that
  bridges the semantic gap between filesystems and object stores.
