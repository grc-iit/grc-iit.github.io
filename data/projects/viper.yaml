title: 'Viper: A High-Performance I/O Framework for Transferring Deep Neural Network Models'
shortDescription: >-
  Within a DL workflow, exchanging DNN models through PFS may result in  high model update latency and discovery
  latency. Moreover, model update frequency affects both training and inference performance. Viper is an I/O framework
  aiming to accelerate model discovery and delivery, and to find an optimal model checkpoint schedule to balance the
  trade-off.
