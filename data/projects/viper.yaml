title: 'Viper: A High-Performance I/O Framework for Transferring Deep Neural Network Models'
shortDescription: >-
  Viper is a high-performance I/O framework that keeps synchronizing the DNN models between training applications
  and inference servers. It learns a predictor to choose
  a near-optimal checkpoint schedule balancing training cost and inference
  quality, and uses memory-first (e.g.,GPU-to-GPU) transfer to reduce model update latency.
