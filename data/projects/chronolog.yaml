title: 'ChronoLog: A High-Performance Storage Infrastructure for Activity and Log Workloads'
shortDescription: >-
  HPC applications generate more data than storage systems can handle, and it is becoming increasingly important to
  store activity (log) data generated by people and applications. ChronoLog is a hierarchical, distributed log store
  that leverages physical time to achieve log ordering and reduce contention while utilizing storage tiers to
  elastically scale the log capacity.
