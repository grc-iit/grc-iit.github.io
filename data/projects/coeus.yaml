shortDescription: >-
  In collaboration with Sandia and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, coeus investigate the use of an active storage
  system to calculate derived quantities and support complex queries on scientific data (simulation and observational)
  as well as optimizing data placement across the storage hierarchy, with awareness of the resource limitations, to
