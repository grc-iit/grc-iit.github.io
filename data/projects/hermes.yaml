title: 'Hermes: Extending the HDF Library to Support Intelligent I/O Buffering for Deep Memory and Storage Hierarchy System'
shortDescription: >-
  To reduce the I/O bottleneck, complex storage hierarchies have been introduced. However, managing this complexity
  should not be left to application developers. Hermes is a middeware library that automatically manages buffering in
  heterogeneous storage environments.
