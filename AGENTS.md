# Agent Guide (Root)

Purpose

- This file orients an automated agent (and humans) to make safe, correct edits.
- The site is data-driven: update YAML in `data/` and pages update automatically via custom plugins.

Tech stack

- Framework: Docusaurus 3 (React 18)
- Dev server: `npm install && npm start` (`http://localhost:4720`)
- Build: `npm run build` → output in `build/`

High-level map (go here for the task you want)

- Add or edit a publication: `data/publications/` (see `data/publications/AGENTS.md`)
- Add or edit a member (researcher/engineer/visiting/external): `data/members/` (see `data/members/AGENTS.md`)
- Add or edit a faculty member: `data/faculty/` (see `data/faculty/AGENTS.md`)
- Add or edit a project definition: `data/projects/` (see `data/projects/AGENTS.md`)
- Add a project details page (MDX content): `src/pages/research/projects/` (see `src/pages/research/projects/AGENTS.md`)

How content flows

- Custom plugins under `plugins/` load YAML and expose the data globally:
  - Publications → `plugins/publications/`
  - Projects → `plugins/projects/`
  - Members (and member-pages) → `plugins/members/`
- List pages are MDX under `src/pages/` and use React components that read plugin data.
- Detail pages are auto-generated by plugins:
  - Publications: `/publications/{slug}`
  - Members (only `type: researcher`): `/members/{slug}`

Quick rules that prevent surprises

- Keep `slug` values unique in YAML. Routes are built from them.
- Publication authors must be short-name strings (e.g., `A. Kougkas`). Member pages match on this form.
- To associate a publication with a project, include the project `name` as a tag in the publication YAML (e.g., `ChronoLog`, `Hermes`, `WisIO`).
- Member photos live in `static/img/members/` and are referenced by filename in YAML.
- Prefer a consistent publication `date` format (e.g., `June, 2025`). Sorting uses `new Date(date)`.

Common entry points

- Publications list: `src/pages/publications.mdx`
- Projects list: `src/pages/research/projects/index.mdx`
- Members directory: `src/pages/members.mdx`

Where to learn details

- See the folder-local `AGENTS.md` for step-by-step, examples, and schema:
  - `data/publications/AGENTS.md`
  - `data/projects/AGENTS.md`
  - `data/members/AGENTS.md`
  - `data/faculty/AGENTS.md`
  - `src/pages/research/projects/AGENTS.md`

Advanced (usually not required for content edits)

- Type definitions: `src/types.ts`
- Publication table and detail UI: `src/components/publications/`
- Member list/item/detail UI: `src/components/people/`
- Project list/cards: `src/components/projects/`
