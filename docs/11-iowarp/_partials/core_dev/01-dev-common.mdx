### Clone the IOWarp Install Repo

```bash
export IOWARP=${HOME}/iowarp
mkdir -p ${IOWARP}
cd ${IOWARP}
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-install.git
```

### Install WrpGit

wrpgit is a command line utility built in Python for manually installing iowarp packages.
Manual installation is necessary for when developing certain packages.

wrpgit should remain in the iowarp-install. Do not install this file
to another directory using something like pip.

```bash
cd ${IOWARP}/iowarp-install
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x wrpgit
```

### Initialize WrpGit

The following initializes wrpgit YAML configuration:
```bash
./wrpgit init
```

It will be stored in ``$IOWARP/iowarp-install/wrpgit.yaml``.
This file looks roughly as follows:
```yaml
username: iowarp 
protocol: ssh
modules:
- name: cte-hermes-shm
  build: True
  fork: False
  type: cmake
  preset: debug
- name: iowarp-runtime
  build: True
  fork: False
  type: cmake
  preset: debug
  depends_on: cte-hermes-shm
```

* ``username``: your github username
* ``protocol``: the protocol to use for clone. Typically ssh.
* ``modules``: the set of manual builds to create. You can add or remove packages from this list.

### Fork IOWarp Repos

If you are working on iowarp, but are not considered full-time staff, we will 
have you fork our code instead of being a branch maintainer. You should be told the specific repos 
you are expected to work on in this case. Make the following changes to the wrpgit.yaml:

```yaml
username: [MY GITHUB USERNAME]
protocol: ssh
token: [MY TOKEN]
modules:
- name: cte-hermes-shm
  build: True
  fork: True  # MAKE THIS TRUE
  type: cmake
  preset: debug
- name: iowarp-runtime
  build: True
  fork: True  # MAKE THIS TRUE
  type: cmake
  preset: debug
  depends_on: cte-hermes-shm
```

To set ``token:``, create a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). 
At minimum, the permissions should be:
```
repo: checked
admin:org: checked
```

And then run:
```bash
./wrpgit fork
```

Any package with ``fork: True`` will be forked from iowarp into the github account
[MY GITHUB USERNAME]. It is ok if you already forked on your own -- the command will
not create a duplicate fork.

### Clone IOWarp Repos

```bash
./wrpgit clone
```

This will clone all packages in the modules list. E.g., ``name: iowarp-runtime`` is assumed
to be the real name of the github repo. When fork: False, it will clone from iowarp. When fork: True,
it will clone from your personal account. It will also add iowarp as a new git remote.
