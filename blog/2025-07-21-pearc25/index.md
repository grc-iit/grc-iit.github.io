## A Milestone Achievement

The Gnosis Research Center (GRC) team achieved a significant milestone by presenting ChronoLog at [PEARC25](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc25/), the premier research computing and data conference. This marked the first major conference presentation of our distributed log system, introducing ChronoLog to the broader research computing community.

## Workshop Success

[Eneko Gonzalez](/members/eneko-gonzalez) and [Kun Feng](http://localhost:4721/members/kun-feng) delivered a comprehensive 3-hour tutorial titled "ChronoLog: Distributed Log System for HPC and Scientific Workflows" to an engaged audience of research computing professionals. The workshop was strategically designed to provide both foundational knowledge and advanced insights into ChronoLog's capabilities for high-performance computing and scientific applications.

The tutorial was divided into two complementary sessions. The first part focused on ChronoLog's architecture fundamentals, deployment strategies, and practical setup techniques, providing attendees with the essential knowledge needed to get started with the system. The second part delved into advanced features, production-ready deployment strategies, and real-world applications across various scientific domains.

The workshop was exceptionally well-received, with attendees from research institutions, industry, and academia actively participating in hands-on demonstrations and engaging in meaningful discussions throughout the tutorial. The interactive learning environment allowed for deep exploration of ChronoLog's capabilities, including its high-concurrency support, multi-tiered storage architecture, and synchronization-free operations.

## About ChronoLog

ChronoLog is a scalable, high-performance distributed shared log store developed by a team of researchers and engineers at Illinois Tech and the University of Chicago. The system is designed for modern scientific computing environments and addresses critical challenges in data management, concurrency, and scalability.

The system leverages multi-tiered storage architecture for optimal performance, supports multiple writers and readers without synchronization overhead, and uses physical time-based ordering for distributed environments. ChronoLog provides specialized support for HPC and research computing applications, making it ideal for scientific workflows across domains including astrophysics, materials science, and geoscience.

## Looking Forward

This successful presentation at PEARC25 represents a pivotal moment in ChronoLog's evolution from research prototype to community-ready platform. The positive reception and engaged discussions demonstrate strong interest in ChronoLog's capabilities for research computing applications. We are committed to continuing our engagement with the research computing community and look forward to sharing ChronoLog's capabilities at future conferences and events.
